carefully today unethical politics has lost tape politics montage politics slander and denigration politics has lost politics without building something politics without plans and projects without goals has lost o general manager  o socalled party chair what would you speak of during your election campaign if you didnt have those tapes we spoke of plans projects they spoke of lies dissimulation slander sedition and intrigue the status quo has taken a huge blow today dirty relations and unnamed alliances have lost today every kind of tutelage and to all kinds of tutelagedictating centers has been hit with a full ottoman slap by the nation arrogance has lost today pride has lost today the arrogance that looks down on its nation belittling it and making light of its choices has lost in the ballot box one again  you know those people who used that blooddripping angerinducing hatemongering headlines today they have lost heavily again o pennsylvania  o the media who support them from here

an expectation of a coup in turkey in  in the  century look at this the nation is here the people are here those whod love to plot a route for turkey through extrapolitical interventions have lost today at the ballot box where are you now  the politics of lies slander blackmail and montage has been destroyed today the solution method of all problems in turkey is politics and democracy unquestionably whatever problem one has politics should be used for the solution whatever problem one has it should be solved at the ballot box  as the ak party we will analyze the election results as we have done in all other elections  why we got   and we could not increase this  to  or   we will sit and discuss this now and after discussing these and coming up with results we will continue on our path after working on our flaws but is the opposition occupied with such an issue no they have always caught unprepared in the elections we will wholeheartedly evaluate the feelings of people who have voted for us and my citizens who have not voted for us the opposition should read the message people have given in the ballot in the correct way the opposition should do healthy selfcriticism  do you know what made me hurt i put aside what has been done against me after what has been done at the foreign ministry have you heard of any statement from this opposition  did you hear them saying this is treason this is espionage we are taking sides with the government against this can those who take sides with pennsylvania say these this was what they said whey said there will be chaos after   they said the economy would collapse did it we will get stronger in the economy in politics and in democracy  come on lets turn over a new page o the opposition o the people who have given their hearts to the opposition turkeys interests must be over everything else we said we are ready to lose if turkey would win the mentality that the ak party should lose regardless of what consequences it will have for turkey must be a thing of the past the principles values must be the fundamentals of the politics lets raise turkey together those who are used by turkeys enemies as pawns were disappointed today these pawns once again saw how glorious how noble how heroic these people are  we have come  to serve the people not to be a master over them we are only the porters of a big stone on the path we were not here yesterday but this path will continue as long as the world stands god willing our flag will continue to wave in the highest bastions forever for this what have we said we have said one nation with turks kurds laz caucasians abkhazians bosniaks and roma people i do not love a turk for being a turk a kurd for being a kurd or a laz for being a laz i love them because allah who has created me has created the  million people we do not discriminate one group is making political kurdishness one group is making political turkishness the chp says i am a party of the coasts one nation one country one flag one state  they have entered our institutions over in  years they infiltrated wherever we became the victim of our good intentions  now it is time to comb them out within the law why because from now on neither the nation nor we will show tolerance to such networks look thank god we have been granted the proud and honor of being at the forefront of this path maybe tomorrow we will not be in these posts we have tried to glorify whatever task my god has given us after now as long as this body has this life god willing we will try to loyally adopt whatever tasks are bestowed onto us if god pleases we will put in an effort to laud our flag and our land as the servants of this country and nation until our last breath we are highly relieved we feel the pride of carrying the great turkish flag which we took over from our predecessors to high bastions  we are at joy to have strengthened politics we have no doubt that the great ak party family will behave with this consciousness today nobody should be sad or sorry the  million people should know that turkey won today every single individual in the  million people should know that the new turkey won today this is the wedding day of the new turkey  today the targets of  won the resolution process won the process of national unity and fraternity won not even one person among the  million lost because a cadre that is ready to serve them without any discrimination is in office they may think differently they may have voted for different political parties they may have cursed us they may have insulted us we have stomached most of them we have taken many of them to court the worthless opposition the status quo coup attempts and tutelage have lost immoral and indecent politics have lost i am thanking once more my nation i am thanking those grandmothers who have prayed nonstop for months even children i am thanking young people my sisters and the gentlemen  i am thanking my brothers who have trusted us and who have believed in us i am thanking those who have prayed for turkey for turkeys stability everywhere in the world i am thanking my organization from my headquarters to provincial organizations district organizations small town organizations and pollingstation observers i am thanking one by one our womens branches our youth branches all of them one by one i wish all the success to the elected mayors city council members metropolitan council members village and neighborhood heads i wish from god that these elections bring goodness to turkey may god protect my country my nation  the nation is invincible i say happy victory let our victory be blessed i salute all of you from my heart and i am asking are we ready  we walked together on these roads we got wet together under the pouring rain in all the songs i am listening to now everything reminds me of you everything reminds me of turkey 
Macron,dear friends  we are here for this general assembly with the secretarygeneral having chosen what is such an important topic the climate and we had a meeting on this issue yesterday at a time when impatience is being expressed everywhere and when everything in the world around us – at any rate many things – might make us pessimistic  climate  we have not met our strict targets the goals we set ourselves in the battle against global warming and for biodiversity there are many tensions at an unprecedented level in certain areas of the world when you see what has happened again in the gulf over the past few days and when you see the challenges facing many of our friends here now particularly in the sahel – whose friendly faces i recognize here – and in so many other regions these conflicts are increasingly tough painful for civilians humanitarian personnel human rights defenders as david miliband says the age of impunity has dawned trade tensions are increasing and there are growing concerns about technological changes and their consequences i do not want to paint a pessimistic picture here and i know you are tired – you have been listening to many speeches since this morning – so i shall spare you the litany of reasons to despair  nevertheless we have got everything we need to respond to these challenges – everything – and in an unprecedented way firstly we have got the knowledge never has world science come together in such a way to describe the challenges we have and anticipate the means of responding to them from the ipcc to ipbes to the extent that we are in the process of building on technological revolutions – this has been spelled out we know a little more each year we have got the finance which is not lacking worldwide we have got the capacity for unmatched innovation which on many of the issues i have talked about is also a means of responding to these challenges of fighting poverty of stabilizing of responding to the major changes i have just mentioned we have got an unprecedented awareness of these presentday ills  our young people when it comes to the climate or freedoms and i must say our public at large which has never been as informed as it is now and we have got a forum right here a forum of free states which recognize one another and are supposed to work for the common good and prepare the future of mankind respond to the current crises just as we have regional multilateral forums on many subjects or topics when we are dealing with trade or economic cooperation  so what are we lacking how is it that speech after speech we make our peoples feel that we will not be able to respond to their fears thinking about it while i was preparing to address you i was reminded of a text which i have often thought back to solzhenitsyns harvard text from  on the decline in courage we lack courage a great deal of it frequently and basically today i simply wanted to tell you that i would like to launch an appeal for a return of courage on two subjects simply to begin with the courage to build peace and the courage to shoulder responsibility  peacebuilding  the courage to build peace first because we need courage to do it because building peace is about taking risks every time it involves not just defending ones basic interests or positions which have at times led to escalation or tensions in every area of the world building peace is about taking risks the risk of dialogue of compromise of rebuilding trust and in so many regions this is what we need it is what the middle east today needs it is what the gulf region needs courage is not about tensions provocations retaliations it is about a dialogue which sets high standards and is monitored transparently  iran  the first time i spoke to this assembly i said i firmly believed on iran that the strategy of exerting pressure visàvis the iran nuclear issue could lead only to a heightening of tensions in the region if it did not basically above all have a clear prospect of a diplomatic solution in  after the us pulled out of the  vienna agreement i proposed a comprehensive framework allowing us to protect the jcpoa and complement it with a wider approach enabling us to address the issues posed by the  iran nuclear programme irans role in regional crises and its ballistic programme what point have we reached today to americas strategy and the desire of europe russia and china to protect the  vienna agreement iran responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its regional environment in this context tensions have risen constantly over the past few months and the attacks on  september against saudi arabia were a game changer following on from that today the risk is one of conflagration on the basis of a miscalculation or a disproportionate response peace is at the mercy of an incident which degenerates and the consequences for the whole region and beyond would be too serious to induce us to live on the brink of the abyss so what do we do i wholeheartedly believe that more than ever it is time for negotiations to be resumed between the united states of america iran the signatories to the jcpoa and the powers in the region first affected by its security and stability  what must the terms the objectives of these negotiations be firstly complete certainty that iran never acquires nuclear weapons secondly an end to the crisis in yemen thirdly a regional security plan including the other crises in the region and the security of maritime traffic flows finally the lifting of economic sanctions i am not being naïve in any way and i do not believe in miracles either i believe in the courage of building peace and i know that the united states of america iran and all the signatories to the agreement have this courage  it is with the same firm belief that we shall continue our work – discussed at length in recent weeks and during the  biarritz summit – on syria libya and the sahel  syria  on syria i want here to welcome yesterdays encouraging announcements made by the secretarygenerals special envoy and a decisive step forward in the formation at last of the longawaited constitutional committee we are all keeping a close eye on the humanitarian situation in idlib we are all committed to the stability of all syrias regions and to the protection of all its people and we shall continue working to build an inclusive lasting political solution in syria this has to involve the work of the constitutional committee at the same time syrian territory has to be made safe and secure so that refugees may return voluntarily and in complete safety it also has to involve a free electoral process which will have to include all syrian citizens  libya  with respect to libya the  summit reaffirmed our goals and our convictions i genuinely believe that we now strongly need an interlibyan conference on reconciliation and the strong commitment of the african union alongside the un in order to achieve this many initiatives have been taken i pay tribute to germanys commitment i pay tribute to the commitment of all stakeholders who want to build peace but lasting peace can only be built based on reconciliation between the libyan people  sahel  with respect to the sahel as you know frances commitment is unwavering and has been renewed here too the future depends on the development of lasting cooperation in the region between the five member countries of the  sahel the commitment of our armies un involvement and the need we now have to change minusmas mandate and to be able to fully integrate our goals – the fight against terrorism lasting security in the sahel – into the missions that we have given ourselves placing minusma under chapter vii mandate continuing to deploy all armed forces in the region recommitting all the security forces in the region to this fight against terrorism and devoting our energy to development and stabilization are essential  these are all situations in which dialogue and the development of political solutions are key to success we have witnessed this courage to build peace take shape over the last few months in an unexpected inconceivable way in sudan thanks to the strength of the sudanese people thanks to the capacity for dialogue between the army and the people thanks here too to the work of the african union and the role of ethiopia whose vision and commitment throughout the region i wish to commend  russiaukraine  it is this same courage to build peace that is now required in ukraine president zelensky has taken the first steps president putin has responded to him progress has been made over the last few weeks we know our goals and the next steps the minsk accords and the capacity to finally build lasting peace on the ground in the next few weeks we will therefore have a summit in the normandy format at the level of heads of state and government  multilateralism  with respect to each of these issues the question we are asked each time is how can we recreate an effective framework for cooperation between states i think that it is possible i do not think that the problems we now have can be resolved by diluting responsibilities or by creating a form of globalization that overlooks the people and in this respect i agree with what president trump said this morning and i also do not think that the crises we are experiencing can be resolved more effectively by retreating into nationalism i truly believe in patriotism as long as it is based on love for ones country as well as universal aspirations i believe deeply in sovereignty as long as it is based on selfdetermination as well as on the need for cooperation  what we need to do now is reinvent what i described in my last speech to you as strong multilateralism this doesnt mean that our multilateralism is tired that we are not listening to ourselves anymore that we are no longer effective no it means acknowledging that we will not find a solution by retreating into nationalism that we will not find a solution without cooperation this cooperation must however produce concrete results engage new stakeholders we have demonstrated the effectiveness of this strong modern multilateralism i think we did so with respect to climate when following the american decision to withdraw from the paris climate agreement we launched the one planet summit together with the un and the world bank this allowed us to preserve our cohesion to engage new stakeholders new investors and businesses we saw this again yesterday at the summit organized by the un where we engaged new actors generated momentum resisted disintegration in this respect the announcement yesterday of russias ratification of this same agreement is a form of success in terms of these initiatives what we have been able to achieve with the coalitions on numerous issues is also a sign of success this is the same strong pragmatic multilateralism that we adopted to combat terrorism on the internet through the aqaba process the christchurch call on  may in paris and i would like to pay tribute to the commitment of king abdullah ii of jordan and the prime minister of new zealand  yesterday we marked a milestone  countries have joined this initiative platforms have been set up to handle operational protocols and remove terrorist content we will do more but we have a concrete genuine response we must continue to develop this capacity to move innovate respond to contemporary challenges this is the spirit of the partnership for information and democracy we must now create this in the area of security  the major problem we now have is that we no longer know how to ensure the stability of a world that is increasingly marked by conflict while we have moved away from the duopoly in which we had lived for decades theres no longer anyone we can turn to as a last resort to guarantee essential balances turmoil is prevailing and we are often too slow to tackle issues effectively i truly believe that this courage to build peace requires us to reaffirm our values the values of human rights and the dignity of the human person which must not be undermined by any form of contemporary relativism concrete recommitment is needed on all the theatres of operation i have just mentioned in order to build peace and stability and propose concrete solutions to peoples  and the courage to assume responsibility with respect to many of our challenges when we talk of contemporary common goods climate education inequality we can say that we know we see we now have many experts who can tell us about and describe in unprecedented detail the situation of our world if we have grown weaker it is because we have decided too often to challenge the truth to contest the facts to take a shortterm view to protect certain interests at times and this has led to a loss of meaning  but the reality is that inequality in our world has again increased between countries within our countries our contemporary capitalism has started to malfunction leading to an unprecedented level of inequality we are no longer able to address extreme poverty or the new forms of inequality inequality of opportunities gender inequality unequal access to education in the poorest regions inequalities in healthcare in terms of access to necessary treatment climate inequality with respect to the most vulnerable countries or the poorest regions that are even more adversely affected by global warming and the loss of biodiversity  inequality  on all these issues last year i presented to you the proposed  agenda and the determination to make the fight against inequality central to this agenda i wanted to give you a very brief overview of this and i think that in this respect this is a contribution that we can make collectively in order to allow a response to emerge so that we can support the collective commitment that has already been made within the framework of the sustainable development goals it means looking beyond the short term it means deciding to change our system  first we are collectively committed to a very proactive agenda for africa and for the sahel for its security stability and development and more broadly for a substantive security development and reciprocity agenda with africa that is why next june france will host a franceafrica summit based on economic partnerships and the involvement of civil society in a spirit of true reciprocity  it is also a gender equality agenda in biarritz we launched the € million afawa initiative to support female entrepreneurs in africa and we will work with angélique kidjo to make sure these projects get under way very quickly this is an initiative proposed by african women and run by the african development bank and the major economic powers have decided to invest in it to show their support we supported dr mukweges fund to protect the victims of sexual violence and launched the global partnership for equality which we expanded for this general assembly and which consists – for those states that are joining it – of adopting at least one measure at the national level to support womens rights drawing inspiration from best practices worldwide this fight for malefemale equality is crucial it is crucial because it is not a given in our societies because women continue to be murdered in france as in so many other nations this matter must be given a legal status and we must work effectively to eradicate this phenomenon particularly as we have not yet done so because in so many nations we are seeing gender equality lose ground and the right of women to control their own bodies and the gains of past decades challenged because wherever inequality between men and women takes root civilization retreats obscurantism grows terrorism increases education declines and growth also declines because each of these nations is deprived of half their potential wealth that too is why we strongly support the un when it comes to this agenda on the basis of these three principles for action – emancipation protection a guarantee of true equality – we will take action ahead of the generation equality forum that will be held in paris in july   years after the beijing declaration which was a milestone in the history of our organization going backwards is out of the question we must take a new step forward  health  we must bring this same fight and this same courage and responsibility to health here too we have witnessed too many setbacks too many problems in accessing treatments in certain regions despite all the efforts that have been made the replenishment conference of the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria will be held in lyon on  october it was on this very stage that in  kofi annan called for the creation of a global fund to fight inequality in potential cures for fatal diseases it was subsequently created with the support of the  and the results are there for all to see  million lives saved  let me tell you the elimination of major pandemics is within reach sixteen million lives can be saved in the coming years we must simply tell ourselves that it is no longer possible for people to understand that for financial reasons for reasons of inequality it is impossible to access treatments to prevent or cure such diseases to keep these diseases from regaining ground that is why we need  billion in lyon we have three weeks and we will put all our energy into making sure that the global fund once again lives up to our aspirations  climate  the climate too entails a fight against inequality and it is another issue that demands courage and responsibility basically there is an ongoing paradox with respect to the climate which we are all getting used to in essence we have offered an outlet for our young peoples impatience we have given them the opportunity to express themselves we tell them we hear you youre amazing and then all too often we continue on with whatever we were already doing that will not work  here i would like to applaud the commitment of the un secretarygeneral and tell you that when it comes to combating climate change and fighting for biodiversity we need to move even more forcefully towards concrete action and overhaul our collective organization the system itself – not just seek to compensate for it or correct it – we must change it ourselves with all of our investors companies and societies first we must expand our goals this is vital if we want to have a chance at keeping temperature increases below  by the end of the century in order to do that we must take action in   in europe we must take the necessary decisions in  on carbon taxing with a higher minimum price and taxation at the borders while we have not convinced certain partners to comply with this agenda these courageous decisions are necessary and they are necessary now all countries must be more broadly committed to a strategy of carbon neutrality by  several have joined this coalition president piñera has just presented it to you we must continue to convince others and remain committed to this crucial strategy india has just indicated its wish to sign on to this agenda and join this coalition i know how much of a proactive effort china is also making on the climate it has been substantial in recent years i know that together if we commit to carbon neutrality we can make profound changes and meet our goals in this regard  in chile and  in europe will be decisive events the second thing is to achieve consistency in our agendas and our efforts as i said yesterday we cant say dont worry were doing a great job on everything while so many countries continue to depend on coal everyone – given their constraints and with the help of the international community and good funding and with respect for every part of our societies of course – everyone must commit to a strategy of getting out of coal and major countries must stop funding new polluting facilities in developing countries even today we are still providing export finance and support for projects in so many countries projects funded by developing countries that involve opening new polluting facilities in a way it is like telling developing countries telling the poorest countries climate change isnt your problem you can keep on polluting its okay for you thats inconsistent and irresponsible lets be honest with ourselves  we must commit all of our development banks as we began doing on sunday to redirect their funding towards sustainable energy everywhere because in africa in asia on the american continent in the pacific getting out of coal – no longer depending on coal – is the future of energy production  similarly we need to build a climate fund that is equal to these ambitions a meeting is planned in a few weeks time again in paris for the replenishment of the climate fund and i call on our major partners in this field to make essential financial contributions several of us have already doubled our contributions make a commitment make a commitment – its essential concerning the issue of consistency as i said yesterday we can no longer have commercial strategies based on openness and free trade if their agendas do not include climate objectives they must go together i believe in openness and free trade but only if this free trade is rational and includes the goals of zero carbon and zero deforestation this means that in each situation we need to come up with the right solutions in each situation we need to find offsetting measures but we cannot push certain countries to make efforts and then continue to do business with countries that do not we cannot keep making statements in this forum and continue to import products that contradict these statements this will not happen overnight france itself still imports far too many products that lead to deforestation major changes are needed partnership strategies are required with countries of origin with businesses and with financiers i am not telling you that everything is fine in france and that we do everything right – far from it but if we are not collectively responsible and transparent and if we refuse consistency between our thoughts and deeds between our trade and climate agendas we will never succeed never it will take a few years but we must start now  there are two climate issues i wish to highlight here before concluding if we are to win this battle we need to focus on forests and the ocean both of these battles are essential in reducing  and preserving the balance of biodiversity in both of these global issues we are losing the battle  as far as forests are concerned yesterday we jointly committed to taking an important step forward in defending the amazon and african forests – in other words our planets primary forest reserves several countries made commitments france among them i would particularly like to acknowledge the major commitments made by germany and norway this involved major countries international organizations nongovernmental organizations and most of the countries concerned by the amazon if i use language appropriate for this forum all those who wish to join should join but we need to make progress between now and the conference of the parties in santiago we will develop extremely effective and pragmatic criteria to invest directly in the field and find useful solutions with a view to encouraging projects in the fields of reforestation biodiversity protection and agroecology – projects that contribute to the economic development of the amazon and african forests in the congo basin while preserving forests and supporting our fight to protect biodiversity and combat global warming in this fight for biodiversity also there are several upcoming events major events in  include the iucn congress in france and  in beijing also in  we must take clear action  concerning the oceans the ipcc report is devastatingly cruel the facts are blatant obvious we are losing the battle in biarritz we began building coalitions with major transport companies which committed to reducing speed this is just a beginning we are far from winning i would like us to commit – as we are doing for primary forests – to defending the oceans to supporting new financing and tangible actions so we can win this battle  for all of these issues these are just the first changes the first steps and i am telling you now what we are collectively trying to do is essential we are collectively trying to change our joint political economic and social structures to reduce inequalities – or even better to prevent them in my opinion given todays growing inequalities in terms of the climate opportunities and education the right answer is not in the tax agenda in each country i think the right answer is in education access to health and inequality prevention policies in each country as well as in more international cooperation and a robust agenda to fight inequalities but this requires fundamentally an agenda of reconciliation what we are now seeing is on the one hand a constant rhetoric of denunciation – i can hear it it pushes us to act but it is no longer sufficient denunciation is no longer the issue we know this our forerunners made denunciations  years ago this resulted in groups of experts so this rhetoric of denunciation is present on the other hand among some people there is a kind of comfort in inaction a practice of cynicism and in the middle there is a crowded perhaps clumsy group of people trying to do things let us dare to take strong action let us build this agenda of reconciliation together with our public opinions with our young people with our businesses with our investors and with willing governments so we can say we have the facts let us continue to look into them and change our practices now – our practices as consumers as producers as investors as leaders and as citizens to collectively embark on this agenda of change but staying within this tandem of denunciation and inaction is pointless i strongly believe that the courage of shouldering responsibility is about facing facts – saying that there are things that can be done now and others that will take more time because in all of our countries we have producers who are dependent on certain products that are harmful we have people living in homes that are not fully insulated people who must travel and pollute while travelling we cannot blame them we have to help them change we have to offer solutions developed through technological innovations through investment and through a real agenda to fight social and climate inequalities this agenda of reconciliation – this is what we need to do this is what i want to do in france what we need to develop in europe and what we need to build here  this ladies and gentlemen is what i wanted to say to you i believe in courage and responsibility and more generally i believe in the return of courage in any case i do not think we have any choice we must work together the rulebook has changed it is less simple than before and requires more commitment on all topics related to security inequality health and the climate we know that we will be held accountable but i do not believe in taking the easy road of pessimism nor do i believe in division i believe in our ability to make proposals think work together and build this agenda of reconciliation which will allow us to again look forward to the future thank you 
Merkel,ladies and gentlemen  nearly  years ago walter hallstein the former german commission president referred to european integration as an endeavour of unparalleled boldness the year was  ten years before the first direct european elections took place at the time the european community was still in its infancy many of our greatest accomplishments – schengen the single market and a single currency – were still mere visions but the foundation had been laid and with that after centuries marked by wars and dictatorships the citizens of europe for the first time held out hope for a sustainable peaceful and stable future  today i am pleased and grateful to be standing in front of the largest democratic parliament in the world together you –  members elected in  member states – represent more than  million people that is nearly seven percent of the worlds population in your house we can feel the heart of european democracy beating the debates which are held in  languages are a sign of this your house also stands for another aspect of europe namely diversity it is one of our great strengths as europeans that we – time and again and despite our diversity – have allowed ourselves to be guided by a willingness to compromise despite our different origins and opinions we have so far always managed to arrive at solutions that benefit the community as a whole  more than eleven years have passed since i first addressed this house at the time in  germany had assumed the presidency of the council of the european union in that speech i spoke about diversity as a unifying rather than dividing factor about freedom that constantly needs to be defended anew and about europe needing freedom the same way that people need air to breathe i also talked about a fundamental value that characterises europe – a value that brings freedom and diversity together in europe i spoke about tolerance i spoke about how tolerance is the soul of europe about how it is an essential fundamental value that defines european idea  over the past eleven years we have also seen how much the world has changed – how if you will europes soul has been put to the test global political economic and technological challenges are developing at an ever greater pace and they are becoming more and more profound we have lived through a great public debt crisis the european union has not been spared the scourge of international terrorism wars and armed conflict are taking place only a few hours by plane beyond our doorstep global refugee and migration flows are also having a direct impact on us europeans the advance of digital technology is changing our way of life at breakneck speed we are feeling the effects of climate change old allies are calling tried and proven alliances into question the united kingdom will be the first country to exit the european union these days are marked by intensive negotiations and we more than ever are getting a sense of how deep that impact will be – i want to express my heartfelt thanks to michel barnier for his work  members of this esteemed house – why am i saying this we all realise that predicting developments has become more difficult but we also realise something else the likelihood that interests can be asserted at global level by a single actor is steadily decreasing vice versa this means it is becoming ever more important for us europeans to take a united stance for this everyone in the european union must now more than ever show respect for others and their interests we must now more than ever have a common understanding that tolerance is the soul of europe that it is a key part of what makes us european and that only through tolerance can we develop a willingness to consider and fully identify with the needs and interests of others this will help us forge true european solidarity without which successful action is impossible this solidarity is built on tolerance it is the basis of our strength as europeans a strength that is unique in the world for three reasons  firstly solidarity is a universal value standing up for one another is an essential prerequisite for every functioning society this holds true for families villages and sports associations as it does for a community such as the european union solidarity is a fundamental component of the european treaties it is an indispensable part of our system of values solidarity is encoded in our european dna we support countries and regions by promoting their economic development or assisting efforts to combat youth unemployment we help one another when natural disasters strike when terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents occur we stand by one another during the european public debt crisis we put together socalled rescue packages to help countries solve their economic and financial problems  these few examples already show that the individual eu member states and thereby also the citizens of the european union are not left in the lurch during tough times and crises however these few examples also show that national decisions always also have an effect on the entire community  therefore secondly solidarity always means that everyone must bear responsibility for the community as a whole specifically this means anyone who undermines ruleoflaw principles in their own country or who curtails rights of the opposition and civil society and restricts the freedom of the press thereby jeopardises the rule of law not only in his or her own country but for everyone in europe europe as a community of law can of course only function when the law applies – and is respected – equally everywhere  anyone who seeks to solve problems only by taking on new debt or who ignores binding obligations also calls into question the foundation of a strong and stable euro area that is because our single currency can only function if every single member meets national obligations for sustainable finances anyone who undermines a unified european stance when interacting with third parties – regarding for example agreed sanctions or questions related to human rights – also undermines the credibility of european foreign policy as a whole because europe will only make its voice heard in the world if it stands united this means that showing solidarity always requires overcoming national egotisms  i am well aware that germany has not always behaved well and that at times others take issue with its behaviour for example in the years before  it took us far too long also in germany to accept that the refugee issue concerns all eu member states and that it must be dealt with through a paneuropean approach  from this it follows thirdly that solidarity that benefits all also ultimately and rightly understood means solidarity that is in everyones own best interest respecting and supporting others on the one hand and pursuing ones own interests on the other hand are not contradictory quite the opposite is true one example is our cooperation with african countries of origin in the sphere of refugees and migration – the president addressed this just a moment ago – this cooperation helps europe because it establishes more orderly controlled and reduced movements of refugees and migrants to europe at the same time it helps people in the countries of origin by improving their living conditions we can also prevent them from embarking on what is often a perilous journey to europe  another example is europes commitment to worldwide climate protection these efforts are an ecological and social necessity for protecting the resources on which life depends – also for everyone here in europe europe benefits when industrialised and newly industrialising countries produce less greenhouse gasses and when all of our economies become greener  what is more all europeans benefit when the euro area too develops harmoniously becoming a haven of strength and stability all europeans benefit when everyone joins in european civil protection efforts all europeans benefit when we help those who are most severely affected by displacement and migration it is a matter of tolerance that we respect the different reactions in the various member states when it comes to the question of taking in refugees – because each member state has its own history and demographic development however it is a matter of solidarity that we do everything in our power to find a common approach for tackling this and other challenges as a community  these are hallmarks of europe solidarity as a universal fundamental value solidarity as a responsibility for the community and solidarity in terms of ones own rational interest  ladies and gentlemen unity and common resolve are essential if europe is to succeed i therefore want to highlight three spheres that i think should be at the top of our agenda  firstly there is our foreign and security policy we already now realise that we europeans are much better able to defend our interests whenever we act in concert only by taking a united stance will europe be strong enough to make its voice heard in the global arena and defend its values and interests its simply true that the times when we could fully rely on others have ended this means nothing other than that if we europeans want to survive as a community we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our own hands this means that in the long term europe must become more capable of taking foreign policy action we must therefore be ready to rethink our decisionmaking processes also by lifting the unanimity requirement wherever possible – that is in areas where this is permitted by the treaties  i have proposed that we establish a european security council with rotating member state membership in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared we need to create a fully capable european military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis we have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain that is a good thing and these efforts have received wide support here  yet – and i say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years – we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper european army yes thats how things stand four years ago jeanclaude juncker said a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries that would not be an army in competition with nato – dont misunderstand me – but it could be an effective complement to nato nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question but ladies and gentlemen it would then be much easier to cooperate with us when as is the case at the moment we have more than  defence or weapons systems and the united states has only  or  when each country needs its own administration support and training for everything we are not an efficient partner if we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives nothing speaks against us being colllectively represented in nato with a european army i dont see any contradiction there at all  that would then also involve  heckling from the floor – i welcome that response that doesnt bother me im used to parliament –  that incidentally would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within europe and it would also involve – this is a difficult task also for the federal republic of germany – developing a joint arms export policy because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world  secondly ladies and gentlemen europes economic success is a crucial factor it forms the basis of our strength and determines whether our voice will even be heard in the world without economic clout we will have no political influence either i am delighted that jeanclaude junckers programme the investment plan for europe has had a significant impact in recent years and that we have already launched  or  billion euros of investments out of a total volume of  billion euros envisaged by  that is a good programme to boost investment i am aware of how often there have been calls for more investment particularly from you in the european parliament that has now been set in motion but we ought to discuss the issue again in due course for ladies and gentlemen  billion euros is not peanuts but a tangible contribution to greater prosperity in europe  it goes without saying that a stable and prosperous europe also requires a stable economic and monetary union we intend to continue to develop the european stability mechanism we are working on the banking union we are working on a eurozone budget a concept proposed by germany and france in my opinion that should be dovetailed very closely with the mediumterm financial perspective we are also advocating that liability and control go hand in hand that means that a banking union and ultimately a european deposit guarantee system are dependent on the prior reduction of risks in the individual countries the two are interconnected european solidarity and individual responsibility are always two sides of the same coin as the european council – germany and france at least are certainly working to achieve this – we will have tangible results to show by december  we will also make progress on one issue that is currently being discussed in great depth and in which you too are heavily involved – digital taxation the question for germany is not whether we have to implement digital taxation – that goes without saying in the digital age – our question is how to proceed i think it is one of the rules of good democratic behaviour that we take note of the commissions proposals but can also supplement them we believe that the best option in an international context would be to find an international solution we advocate minimal taxation but if that doesnt work we cant afford to wait until doomsday but should take a europewide approach and that ladies and gentlemen is what germany is working to achieve  if we are honest when we look to the future and stop to think about our prosperity we have to accept that the major innovations now no longer always or usually come from europe as was the case  years ago and  years ago today a large proportion of groundbreaking innovations come from asia and from the united states that of course begs the question will we dictate the form of the mobility of the future on the continent which once invented the car it bothers me for example that we arent able to manufacture battery cells the fact that chinese enterprises are now investing in germany is okay but i think we ought to make a great effort to ensure that in europe we are also in a position to master a drive technology of the future and to make the production of battery cells possible here too we have the european instruments to achieve this we have all that at our disposal – as we already do with chips today  we need to be among the leaders in quantum computers we need to develop a joint strategy for artificial intelligence all this is still possible because we have a strong industrial basis in europe we can build on this and we now need to make use of it research and innovation are therefore central factors in our future prosperity  ladies and gentlemen the third issue i want to raise is the topic of refugees and migration during the euro crisis we had many obstacles to overcome in order to reach a joint solution but we succeeded but on the issue of refugees and migration europe is not yet as united as i would like as this is a central issue which concerns relations with our neighbourhood we need to find common approaches here  we have indeed made progress we all agree that we need common european border management with hindsight i will say that it was no doubt somewhat careless to create a schengen area of free movement but only now to work on compiling entry and exit records in order to confirm who is in our country and who is leaving nonetheless it is right that we are doing so now it is right that we are developing frontex in my view the commission proposals are good here too the important point is this if every country wants to retain its national competence and nobody wants to hand over any responsibility to the european border guards no matter how extensive and how competent they are they will not be able to do their job in this area too we need to forego our national competences to some degree and work together  we also need to consider how we can best share the workload with regard to development assistance development cooperation and economic development in africa we are now seeing outstanding results – that wouldnt have been possible two or three years ago – when individual member states work in cooperation with the commission in specific african countries and thereby achieve so much more than if we all headed off there to do our own thing yet we have a great deal more to learn in this area nonetheless i believe we are moving in the right direction  another priority needs to be for us to develop a common european asylum procedure if every country makes decisions based on different criteria the people affected are aware of this and then it is no wonder that secondary movement takes place within the schengen area it is vital that just as we are developing a common level playing field for the internal market we make the effort to develop common standards also on such sensitive issues as asylum law and humanitarian responsibility otherwise we will not be able to handle the task with which refugees and migration confront us  ladies and gentlemen those were just three examples of many the protests show that i have hit the mark that is good and i am honoured i believe that people want europe to tackle the very issues that are uppermost in their minds people want a europe that provides answers to their burning questions that doesnt mean that europe has to have a finger in every pie as it were it is still the case that not every problem in europe is a problem for europe solidarity does not mean omnipresence but solidarity does mean that europe engages itself where it is needed and that it is then able to act firmly decisively and effectively  i am convinced that europe is our best chance for lasting peace lasting prosperity and a secure future our gathering in paris at the invitation of the french president to remember the brutalities of the first world war  years ago ought to have reminded us once again what happens when nations have no respect for one another and what happens when alliances such as the league of nations which was founded in the wake of the first world war fail even greater horrors followed this is why we cannot afford to squander this european opportunity we owe that to ourselves we owe it to generations past and we owe it to future generations that means that nationalism and egoism must never again be allowed to gain a foothold in europe rather tolerance and solidarity are our common future ladies and gentlemen that is something absolutely worth striving for  thank you very much 
Nicolas_Maduro,ambassadors heads of delegations of the countries members of the united nations organization presidentelect of the general assembly mrs maria fernanda espinoza may i extend to you the congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the bolivarian republic of venezuela – our government – on assuming the presidency of the  session of the general assembly as the first latinamerican woman to be president of a general assembly session in this occasion we have been invited to work and address an important and vital issue entitled as follows making the united nations relevant to all people global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies so we are here to make the united nations relevant for all people  this is precisely a noble purpose up to what the united nations system has to build in light of the  century a century of great opportunities and certainly a century that will make the difference regarding the human liberation processes – political liberation peoples liberation – that sooner or later will impact significantly on the future of the united nations organization  the current united nations organization was born at the end of second world war  during the  century its configuration expressed the conflicts and forms of actions by the bipolar world of the postwar years and after the fall of the soviet union in the  we moved to a unipolar world  the correlation of forces in the world regarding the world system has always influenced the united nations organization directly however in order to be relevant – according to the purpose of this  general assembly – this organization has to express the wishes the way of being the culture the political thinking the strength and the hopes of the majorities in the world  that is why venezuela is here today to say its truth i bring the truth of a combative heroic and revolutionary world i bring the voice of a homeland that throughout history has refused to surrender to injustice to the empires of the past – slaver and colonialist – and the empires of today – equally slaver and neocolonialist i bring the voice of a heroic people that arose from the heroic resistance of the aborigines from the indigenous peoples that for centuries resisted the domination by colonial empires i bring the voice of the people having the honor of being the great liberator simon bolivars home the most important leader of a generation of liberators of the americas who accomplished  years ago the heroic feat of founding a continent a region a dream the independent republics of this world region  venezuela is a historic people which is both a home and a school of republican values a home and a school of rebelliousness a home and a school of dignity and values such as equality such is our obstinate homeland that for centuries has searched its independence and sovereignty  i speak on their behalf before this scenario which has witnessed the most evil and embarrassing attacks in the last years for our country is a harassed and attacked country yesterday in this same place the president of the united states of north america once again attacked the noble people of venezuela and supported as he said the doctrine founded by the empire of the united states  years ago which determined their interventionist role their intended role of judge party and police of the world the monroe doctrine yes the president of the most powerful imperial nation the united states of north america was in this same place supporting james monroes doctrine who at that time said america for americans meaning that the rest of america had to belong to them as the backyard for the interests of washington elite groups that already conducted the configuration of that nation as a former colony of the british empire  he supported the monroe doctrine and you may be wondering about the reason for such fierce attack by the american power expressed at all levels by president donald trump it is a historic conflict as we have said to the world many times as our people well knows it is the conflict between the interventionist imperial neocolonialist monroe doctrine against the historic independence republican simon bolivars doctrine of rebelliousness dignity justice liberty and equality it is an old conflict an old contradiction due to an imperial doctrine aimed at dominating our region during the  century it was aimed at dominating our region only however in the  century it was intended to dominate the world and in the  century it tries to continue governing conducting blackmailing and arranging the world as if it were their property in our region it is a  contradiction between the republican libertarian flags which in the  century – the time of simon bolivar and the liberators – advocated for a world of equilibrium and respect and the pro imperialist and interventionist flags that promoted the domination of the region by an elite group that already had the control of the power in washington  it is an old conflict we know very well today venezuela is a victim of a permanent aggression in the economic political diplomatic and media fields by those who govern the united states of north america and support the monroe doctrine to justify the ideological political and diplomatic aggression against our beloved homeland  our reason for being here is the reason why is venezuela being politically economically and diplomatically attacked first of all venezuela has built an autonomous project of democratic revolution social vindication and construction of a self and new model of society which is based on the historical roots of our nation on the identity of our country and on the own culture of our latinamerican region  for  years they have been intended to stop the course of our history the development of a revolutionary project that arose from the own struggle root of our people and region secondly – and perhaps more understandable for global geopolitical reasons venezuela is the nation with the largest oil reserve of the world internationally certified venezuela as founder of opec venezuela a country with  years of oil production discovered and certified internationally the largest oil richness of the world venezuela has also significant natural and mining richness today according to international standards our country is certifying the potentially biggest gold reserve of the world  the world must know that currently apart from being the biggest international oil reserve venezuela is certifying under international standards the biggest gold reserve of the world and the fourth gas reserve of the world as well the significant natural resources important geopolitical geoeconomic and geostrategic position have lead the oligarchies of the continent and those who dominate from washington to consider dominating and controlling the political power in venezuela in the present venezuela is victim of a permanent aggression  in the economic sphere during the last two years venezuela has been subjected to a set of illegal unilateral measures of economic persecution and blockade we have been restrained from using the international currency –the dollar via positions of use of dominion by the authorities of the us department of treasury currently venezuela cannot negotiate any international transaction in dollars did the world know that venezuela is persecuted from an economic commercial and monetary point of view today venezuela is target of a set of illegal and unilateral mechanisms of economic sanctions  yesterday the president of the united states announced precisely on this same platform new and alleged economic and financial sanctions against our country in the sanctuary of the law and international legality did the united nations system know that the unilateral sanctions using the dominion the status of the currency and the financial persecution are considered illegal from the standpoint of international law venezuela is subjected to a permanent media aggression as well attempts to forge a file have been made to justify an international intervention we know that it is an intended international intervention a military intervention to control our country at global level a file has been forged through the media against our country to pretend a humanitarian crisis that uses the united nations concepts to justify a coalition of countries led by the government of the united states and their satellite governments in latin america to get its hands on our country a migration crisis that goes without saying has been forged by several means aimed at diverting the attention from the real migration crises in the world that show the disadvantages of the southern countries the migratory crisis in central america mexico and latin america arising due to the announcement of a retaining wall against our peoples a dividing wall against them nobody wants to talk about this situation a doublestandard treatment has been intended over the real status of the caribbean and latin american migrants who have been persecuted along the border with mexico they have been separated from their families their kids have been kidnapped and no response is given about this issue or about the serious migration crisis caused by the destruction in libya by nato and the war against syria resulting in the migration of thousands of african and middleeast brothers it is an issue that is intentionally masked  a global media campaign about an alleged migratory crisis in venezuela has been deployed to justify a humanitarian intervention as announced for years it is a plan similar to the weaponof massdestruction plan used in iraq it is the same plan that justified the intervention in other countries this time under a form of a great brutal psychological warfare campaign today venezuela is also the victim of a diplomatic nature aggression yesterday – dear brothers and sisters of the governments of the world – we witnessed direct threats to cut aid to withdraw aid or blockade aid from the international support and aid systems for the governments and peoples of the world on the need of it by the president of the united states  we have listened to the statements issued by several governments demanding better mechanisms to access financing to access development to which our peoples are entitled to yesterday the president of the united states in this very platform threatened the governments of the world to submit to its designs to its orders and to cooperate with its policies in the united nations system or he would act accordingly venezuela has been attacked with a fierce diplomatic offensive at all of the united nations system bodies supported by satellite kneeled governments blackening the honor of the peoples that they are called to represent  venezuela has been subjected to permanent political aggression on september  the new york times published an article evidencing the participation of officials of the white house and the government of the united states in meetings to bring about a military coup and cause a change of government a change of regime in venezuela the investigation published by the new york times – replicated by the times magazine the washington post and the world press – simply confirmed the conspiracy the permanent aggression by factors of the government of the united states against a constitutional and strengthened democracy a democracy supported by the people such as the venezuelan democracy we had already denounced in due course the attempts of violence against the constitution the attempts of disturbances and military coups against the constitutional and revolutionary government over which i preside in the bolivarian republic of venezuela by popular will and popular vote  after announcing and publishing the failed attempts of disturbances and military violence – the new york times published details on how us officials in colombia supported by the colombian government and colombian institutions met and offered their encouragement and support for this attempted change of regime should the united nations system should the union – i am addressing my latin american and caribbean brothers – should latin america and the caribbean accept these methods that so hurt our region in the entire  century how many military interventions how many coup détats how many dictatorships were imposed during the long and dark  century in latin america and the caribbean and who did it favor did it favor the peoples what interests did they represent the interests of the transnational companies the unpopular interests long dictatorships like augusto pinochets in chile were faced by our peoples due to the stubbornness of the american elites and the monroe doctrine to deny the right earned by ourselves to govern our countries the way we need and build specific economic political and cultural systems of the region  that is why i come here to bring the truth of a fighting people venezuela has been targeted by a seemingly neverending political and media campaign that is why we bring our homelands truth to this honorable un general assembly after the failure published and announced by the new york times of these illegal unconstitutional and criminal attempts of regime change after the democratic presidential election last may  when i nicolas maduro moros obtained  of the popular votes through free elections – the  election in  years of which  have been won by the revolutionary forces of the bolivarian republic of venezuela at different levels of approval against the opposition forces of our country after the failure of the attempted military coups candidacies and electoral tactics supported by washington with the huge electoral victory attained by the people last august  i was a victim of a terrorist attack with drones that tried to kill me in a military event on one of the main avenues in caracas if it had been executed as planned it would have been a massacre an assassination of the institutional political and military high command of our nation venezuela  on august  the perpetrators the terrorists those who attacked me with drones – this is the first attack with drones known in the world history of terrorist violence – were captured by the security bodies and state police agencies the  perpetrators were captured thanks to different investigation procedures they are convicted and sentenced as i informed to different governments of the world all the investigations about that terrorist attack indicate that it was prepared financed and planned in the territory of united states of america i have informed to the government of united states – by diplomatic means – the name the responsibility and the evidences of the intellectual perpetrators financers and planners of this serious terrorist attack according to investigations this attempt and the actual perpetrators – as they have admitted – were trained and prepared for months in colombian territory under the protection and support of colombian authorities and according to the latest investigations and captures – as unveiled to the media – the perpetrators mentioned some of the diplomatic members of the government of chile colombia and mexico who would help them to escape after the terrorist attack  i would like to ask the united nations system to appoint a special delegate of the secretariat of the united nations to conduct an independent investigation internationally about the implications and responsibilities of this terrorist attack perpetrated in our country venezuela is opened the doors of our country and our judicial system are opened in order to determine the direct responsibilities of this aggression the most serious in the political history of our country for its implications they tried to provoke a chaos in our homeland they tried to rip the states head off to justify a domestic struggle a domestic violence and justify the activation of mechanisms beyond the united nations multilateral system of a military intervention as occurred in other countries in the past  officially venezuela proposes ambassador minister for foreign relations – to conduct an independent international investigation to determine the truth about these events i have expressed to the government of united states – who has denied its participation in the preparation and execution of these attempts  that it will be great if they heed my call to include highlevel fbi professionals and scientists in this investigation to clarify and help the venezuelan justice to find the truth  when i arrived in new york this the afternoon i heard that some journalists had asked president donald trump if he was willing to meet with maduro thats how people call me with nicolas maduro president of venezuela apparently president donald trump in one of his todays interventions said that if it helps venezuela he was willing to do so well i ratify on this platform that despite the great historical differences ideological and social differences – since i am a worker a bus driver a man of the people i am not a rich man i am not a millionaire – despite all the differences deemed as enormous the president of venezuela nicolas maduro moros is willing to shake hands with the us president i am willing to sit and talk about the bilateral differences and the matters of our region  i believe so venezuela is a friendly country venezuelans do not hate the united states on the contrary we appreciate the united states their culture their arts their society we differ from the imperial concepts that took over the political power in washington since the foundation of that nation in  our liberator simon bolivar said prophetically the united states appear to be destined by providence to plague america with hunger and misery in the name of liberty  it was a prophetic vision it was hard to see at early times the future in the  century do we have differences president donald trump of course we do but differences lead to dialogue those who are different are called to put their good will and words on the table president donald trump said he is worried about venezuela that he wants to help venezuela  well i am willing to talk with an open agenda about the topics that the united states government wants to discuss with humility frankness and honesty as president of the nonaligned movement venezuela raises the flags of dialogue among civilizations as president of the nonaligned movement venezuela permanently promotes and practices the political and international dialogue the solution of the international conflicts through the dialogue the understanding and the pacific uses of politics and not by force  venezuela is significantly experienced in bodies such as opec to manage situations of divergence and build consensus and agreements recently in algeria we attended the meeting of the opec monitoring committee it was an extraordinary meeting with the representatives of the monitoring committee since we are part of it and the representatives of  states with the greatest oil reserves and producers of the world and despite the cultural political geostrategic and geopolitical differences we reached an agreement a single voice to continue stabilizing the oil market at fair reasonable and stable prices  we believe in the political dialogue as a way to find solutions and solve conflicts they have tried to demonize the bolivarian revolution through an unprecedented brutal campaign first against commander hugo chavez frias founder of our revolution and eternal commander in the heart of venezuelans and then against this humble man who is standing here bringing the voice of a people that supports its revolution and democratically supports its actions  therefore i reaffirm the desire for international and national political dialogue i know that governments represented in this room are interested in reaching peace with sovereignty independence and justice in venezuela i welcome all those from africa europe asia latin america who wish to help respecting the countrys sovereignty without interfering in venezuelas internal affairs so that they can support us join us in a process of sovereign dialogue for venezuelas peace democracy justice future and prosperity a noble nation which deserves peace a future and the best  we bring good news from a country that has not given up and shall not do so good news from a nation that is consolidating its democracy good news from a country that is building its own social model its own welfare state by means of new formulas to protect its elders its pensioners its children its young people its women the neediest sectors its working class we also bring good news regarding the efforts for an economic recovery in fact i activated in august an economic recovery growth and prosperity program which is succeeding in placing the bases of a new economy not dependent on oil revenues a diversified economy of sustainable growth and prosperity building heading towards a new kind of social model  we believe in a different world our generation witnessed the socalled bipolar world the socalled cold war which some apparently want to bring back again through attacks against china russia and modest countries like venezuela however provoking a fight against countries like russia and china is a contradiction of what a humanitarian international policy should be meaning one which recognizes the emergence of new poles of power and the need to build a multipolar world  venezuela is a country which advocates for and is committed to the construction of a pluripolar and multicentric world where all the different regions africa latin america the caribbean asia europe and north america can live together in balance and peace respecting our cultures religions idiosyncrasies identities and economic and political models there is not a unique economic model we must not allow the imposition of a single cultural model a single political model they intend to impose a single thought for humanity i say no we vindicate the cultural religious and political diversity of humanity of this world therefore in the nonaligned movement we advocate for the emergence of such a world of justice we assume and declare our solidarity with the arab people of palestine justice shall arrive to palestine so that their historic territories established in  by this united nations organization are respected  we carry with us the flag of the palestinian people we support the un call for an end to the infamous and criminal  against the cuban people we have had enough of anachronistic methods that they intend to continue imposing against the cuban people and now against other peoples like venezuela  so we raise our two hands to vote on the united nations resolution which in the next few days will be carried out to reject the blockade and economicfinancial persecution against cuba and demand its immediate lifting in a world to be built in a world to be made   years ago our region was plagued by colonies slavery and injustice  years ago as peoples we struggled for freedom today in the  century the moment has come the opportunity has come undoubtedly in the bolivarian republic of venezuela with simon bolivars revolutionary ideas with the example and legacy of commander hugo chavez – whose voice still resonates here in this room demanding justice and justice for the world demanding the cessation of the imperial practices of threats coercion and extortion against peoples – we can say that in  years of revolution the last  have been the hardest years years of harassment aggressions and attacks  today on september   i can say that we have faced political media diplomatic economic and financial persecutions but i also can say that today venezuela is stronger than ever we have learnt how to resist and draw the strength from our historic roots to stand up victorious and willing to continue advancing in the construction of our own social model which it is the socialist revolution of the  century we say it to the four winds it is a new revolution of independence dignity and justice  today we are stronger than ever yes i was a witness we were witnesses two days ago of the tribute to nelson mandela speaking about mandela is speaking about rebellion many people have tried to create a wrong picture of mandela like a dump person somebody who did not fight mandela is synonym of rebellion against injustice bravery courage and the challenge to the oppressors we are followers of nelson mandelas legacy and the great african leaders who have raised the struggle for equality justice and against slavery racism and colonialism in all its forms  we saw the tribute to nelson mandela and we thought how much this world has changed just  years ago mandela was considered a terrorist by the united states congress and the north american governments just a few years ago nelson mandela was still on the list of sanctioned people it may sound familiar to you nelson mandela the terrorist the sanctioned the persecuted and the abandoned the world has changed a lot since then currently nelson mandela is a flag that we embrace with love with conviction he is a symbol of what it is possible to do if the rebellion the struggle and justice are able to conquer the noble hearts and minds of the peoples  i trust in the future of humanity in the destiny of my country in the common future of this community represented here in the united nations organization and i must say after having resisted coup détat attempts terrorist attacks that i trust the human being the future of humanity venezuela says to the united nations we trust in the noble ideals of the venezuelan people that do not give up and will not surrender thank you very much dear compatriots of the world count on venezuela for the great causes of the future of this organization and the future of a multipolar world good evening to all of you thank you 
Obama, my fellow citizens  i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition  fortyfour americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents  so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans  that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet  these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land  a nagging fear that americas decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights  today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america  they will be met  on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord  on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics  we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the godgiven promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness  in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the fainthearted  for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risktakers the doers the makers of things  some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom  for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life  for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth  for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn  time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction  this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions  that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america  for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act  not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technologys wonders to raise health cares quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do  now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage  what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them  that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works  whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the publics dollars will be held to account  to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day  because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control  and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart  not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good  as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expediences sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more  recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint  we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort  even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hardearned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes well work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you  for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus  and nonbelievers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace  to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their societys ills on the west  know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist  to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the worlds resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it  as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol faroff deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all  for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate  our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends  honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism  these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility  a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task  this is the price and the promise of citizenship  this is the source of our confidence  the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny  this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed  why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath  so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of americas birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet   america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our childrens children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and gods grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations  thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america 
Putin,citizens of russia members of the federation council and state duma  todays address is a very special landmark event just as the times we are living in when the choices we make and every step we take are set to shape the future of our country for decades to come  it is at such turning points that russia has proven time and again its ability to develop and renew itself discover new territories build cities conquer space and make major discoveries this unwavering forwardlooking drive coupled with traditions and values ensured the continuity in the thousandyearlong history of our nation  we have gone through major challenging transformations and were able to overcome new and extremely complex economic and social challenges preserved the unity of our country built a democratic society and set it on the path to freedom and independence  we ensured sustainability and stability in almost all areas of life which is critical for a huge and multiethnic country like ours with its complex federative structure and diversity of cultures with historical divides that are still alive in peopleís memory and major challenges russia had to face over the course of its history  however sustainability is the foundation of development but not its guarantee we have no right to allow a situation when the stability that has been achieved would lead to complacency all the more so as many problems remain unresolved  today russia ranks among the worldís leading nations with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential but we have not yet reached the required level in the context of accomplishing our highly important task and guaranteeing peopleís quality of life and prosperity but we must do this and we will do this  as i said in the past the stateís role and positions in the modern world are not determined only or predominantly by natural resources or production capacities the decisive role is played by the people as well as conditions for every individualís development selfassertion and creativity therefore everything hinges on efforts to preserve the people of russia and to guarantee the prosperity of our citizens we must achieve a decisive breakthrough in this area  i repeat a solid foundation has been created for this therefore we can now set and accomplish new tasks we already have substantial experience in implementing ambitious programmes and social projects the russian economy has proved its resilience and the current stable macroeconomic situation opens up new opportunities for surging ahead and maintaining longterm growth  finally the world is now accumulating a tremendous technological potential making it possible to achieve a real breakthrough in improving the peopleís quality of life and modernising the economy the infrastructure and state governance and administration how effectively we will able to use the colossal potentialities of the technological revolution and how we will respond to its challenges depends on us alone in this sense the next few years will prove decisive for the countryís future i reiterate these years will be decisive  i will tell you why what i will say now has no connection to the domestic political cycle or even the presidential election no matter who is elected president each russian citizen and all of us together must be able to see what is going on in the world what is happening around us and what challenges we are facing  the speed of technological progress is accelerating sharply it is rising dramatically those who manage to ride this technological wave will surge far ahead those who fail to do this will be submerged and drown in this wave  technological lag and dependence translate into reduced security and economic opportunities of the country and ultimately the loss of its sovereignty this is the way things stand now the lag inevitably weakens and erodes the human potential because new jobs modern companies and an attractive life will develop in other more successful countries where educated and talented young people will go thereby draining the societys vital powers and development energy  as i have said changes concern the entire civilization and the sheer scale of these changes calls for an equally powerful response we are ready to provide it we are ready for a genuine breakthrough  my confidence is based on the results we have achieved together even though they may seem modest at first glance as well as on the unity of russian society and most importantly on the huge potential of russia and our talented and ingenious people  in order to move forward and to develop dynamically we must expand freedom in all spheres strengthen democratic institutions local governments civil society institutions and courts and also open the country to the world and to new ideas and initiatives  it is high time we take a number of tough decisions that are long overdue we need to get rid of anything that stands in the way of our development and prevents people from fully unleashing their potential it is our obligation to focus all resources and summon all our strength and willpower in this daring effort that must yield results  otherwise there will be no future for us our children or our country it is not a question of someone conquering or devastating our land no that is not the danger the main threat and our main enemy is the fact that we are falling behind if we are unable to reverse this trend we will fall even further behind this is like a serious chronic disease that steadily saps the energy from the body and destroys it from within step by step quite often this destructive process goes unnoticed by the body  we need to master creative power and boost development so that no obstacles prevent us from moving forward with confidence and independently we must take ownership of our destiny  colleagues  what should be our priority let me reiterate that i believe that the main key development factor is the wellbeing of the people and the prosperity of russian families  let me remind you that in   million people lived below the poverty line which amounted to nearly  percent ñ  percent of the population in  this indicator fell to  percent  poverty has increased slightly against the backdrop of the economic crisis today  million russian nationals live in poverty of course this is much fewer than the  million people in  but it is still way too many there are even working people who have to live very modest lives  for the first time in our recent history the minimum wage was equated with the subsistence level this provision will come into force on may   and will benefit about  million people this is an important step but it still falls short of offering a fundamental solution  we need to upgrade the employment structure that has become inefficient and archaic provide good jobs that motivate people improve their wellbeing and help them uncover their talents we need to create decent wellpaid jobs this would help deliver on one of the key objectives for the next decade which is to guarantee sustained longterm real income growth and to reduce the poverty rate by at least one half over the next six years  it is our moral duty to provide allround support to members of the older generation who have made a tremendous contribution to national development senior citizens must have worthy conditions for a long active and healthy life most importantly we must raise pensions and index them regularly so that they outpace inflation we will also strive to reduce the gap between the size of pensions and preretirement wages and of course we must raise the quality of healthcare and social support for senior citizens and help people who are alone and those facing problems in life  we need to address all these issues using a comprehensive approach as i see it the future new government will have to draft a special programme for the systematic support of senior citizens and for improving their quality of life  we consider every person important and valuable people need to know that they are needed and they must live a long and healthy life and enjoy their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren they need to see their children grow up and become successful in a powerful rapidly developing and successful country that is attaining new development levels  russia must firmly assert itself among the five largest global economies and its percapita gdp must increase by  percent by the middle of the next decade this is a very difficult task i am confident that we are ready to accomplish it  of course life expectancy is a highly important fundamental parameter for gauging the wellbeing of citizens and the country in  russia posted a life expectancy of just over  years with menís life expectancy falling below  years this is not just low it is a tragedy and this parameter is tragically inadequate  in the past few years russia has been posting a major increase in average life expectancy levels which is among the highest in the world we have managed to accomplish this task life expectancy levels have increased by over seven years and now total  years but of course this is not enough either today we must set an entirely new goal by the end of the next decade russia must confidently join the club of countries posting a life expectancy of  years which includes japan france and germany  at the same time life expectancy levels for people living a healthy active and full life when they are not hampered and pinned down by illness must grow faster than planned i am confident that we can achieve this goal considering the positive trends of the previous years for this purpose the whole of russia will have to make a quantum leap in its development so that the life of every person is transformed  colleagues  we need to create a modern living environment and transform cities and villages across the country in doing so we must make sure that they preserve their identity and historical heritage we already have positive experience in renovating the urban environment and infrastructure let me elaborate on this point cities like kazan vladivostok and sochi have already benefited from upgrades of this kind change is underway in many regional capitals and smaller cities overall we now know how to do it  i propose launching a largescale spatial development programme in russia which would include developing cities and other communities by at least doubling spending in this area over the next six years  it is obvious that the effort to develop cities and other communities goes hand in hand with tihe need to overcome challenges in other areas including healthcare education environment and transport initiatives in all these segments will require additional funding i will talk about this matter further in my address  urban renovation should be supported by the introduction of stateoftheart construction technology and materials modern architectural solutions digital technology for social services transport and utilities sectors among other things this would make the housing and utilities sector more transparent and efficient so that people receive quality services at a reasonable cost  this largescale project brings the promise of better economic and social development prospects a modern living environment and a favourable climate for cultural and civil initiatives for small businesses and startups all this would facilitate the emergence of a large and creative middle class in russia  of course a lot will depend on municipal and local authorities and whether they will be receptive to new ideas the ability to respond to the diverse needs of various generations including families with children retirees and people with disabilities will also be instrumental  people must have a decisive say in the future of their cities and villages we have discussed this many times including at meetings with heads of municipalities today i am not saying it just to check the box i ask you to bring it to the attention of decisionmakers at all levels  it is important that the development of cities becomes the driving force for the whole country russia is a country with a vast territory and its active dynamic life cannot be concentrated in several metropolitan cities big cities must distribute their energy and serve as a support for the balanced harmonious spatial development of the whole of russia  therefore there is an urgent need for an appropriate modern infrastructure i will return to this later however it is obvious that developed utilities is what will enable residents of small towns and villages to take advantage of all the opportunities and modern services that are available in big cities and smaller towns will be closely integrated into russiaís single social and economic space at the same time we will support initiatives that will help our small towns and villages to preserve their cultural identity to rediscover their unique potential in a new way  particular attention will be paid to the social and infrastructural development of rural areas russian agriculture has already become a globally competitive industry therefore people who work for this success should live a comfortable and modern life  colleagues  i understand how important it is for everyone for every family to have their own house their own home i know this is the problem of problems in russia it lingers from decade to decade how many times governments promised and tried sincerely tried to resolve it but we can and must do it now  in  three million families in russia improved their living conditions now we need to reach a stable level i emphasise this it is the first time in the history of modern russia ñ to a level where at least five million families improve their housing conditions annually this is a difficult task ñ to jump from three million to five we reached  million last year but we need to make it five yet it is an attainable goal  i see three key factors for increasing the affordability of housing the first is the growth of peopleís incomes i have spoken about this in the past and we must ensure this next a decrease in mortgage interest rates and of course an increased supply in the housing market  i would like to remind you of something that few people remember which is that only  mortgage loans were issued in  only  the interest rate was as high as  percent including on foreign currency loans by the way half of the mortgage loans were issued in foreign currency few people could afford to take out mortgage loans then last year the number of mortgage loans almost reached one million in december the average interest rate on ruble loans for the first time decreased to below  percent  we know of course that loan terms are individual and may differ from one borrower to another but we must continue to lower the average interest rate to  percent we held long discussions on the figure i should say here i am sure that the target figure should be  percent in the next six years mortgage loans must become accessible to the majority of russian families working people and young professionals  here are some more figures in the  through  we annually built approximately  million square metres of housing a year the figure rose to  million by the late  now we annually build around  million square metres of housing every year we built even more housing in some years but the average figure is  million we must move forward and reach new heights in this sphere that is increase the volume of housing built every year from  million to  million square metres this is an ambitious but realistic goal given new technologies the experience our construction companies have accumulated as well as new materials the rise from  to  million square metres is what we need and can achieve i will tell you why if we want  million families to receive new housing every year we must reach the figure of  million square metres  those who invest their money in housing projects must be securely protected we should gradually proceed from unit construction to project financing when developers and banks but not people shoulder the risks  i also propose revising the personal property tax it must be fair and affordable  some people including those in this hall tried to convince me that this tax should be based on the market value of property they told me that using obsolete valuation by the technical inventory bureau is an anachronism but it turned out in reality that cadastral value which should be comparable to market value often exceeded it by far this was not the agreement and the people did not expect this from us  we must revise the mechanism for calculating the tax and also the calculation of the cadastral value of property one way or another it must not exceed the real market value all decisions regarding this must be taken without delay in the first six months of this year  colleagues  we must penetrate the whole country with advanced communications to develop cities towns to enhance business activity and to meld together russiaís entire territory  the crimean bridge will open to cars in just a few months and to trains next year this will stimulate the development of crimea and the entire russian black sea region  we have overhauled federal roads now we must modernise regional and local routes i am not going to talk about the figures now but i know them it is a fact that federal roads have mostly been renovated the situation is somewhat worse with regional roads and it is completely unacceptable with local roads i address this to regional and city heads you must constantly focus your attention on the roads you must improve the quality of road construction using advanced technology and solutions infrastructure mortgage loans and life cycle contracts  of course another critical task is to improve safety on the roads and to decrease the mortality rate in road accidents to the minimum  overall in the next six years we must almost double the spending on road construction and repairs in russia and to allocate more than  trillion roubles for this from all sources this is a lot keep in mind that we have allocated  trillion rubles in  but we need  trillion  large eurasian transport corridors will also be developing an automobile road that will become part of the europe ñ asiapacific corridor is already under construction our chinese and kazakhstani partners involved in this project together with us have already completed their part their sections have already been opened so we need to speed up our work  the throughput capability of the baikalamur mainline and the transsiberian railway will grow  times up to  million tonnes in six years it will take seven days for containers from vladivostok to reach the western borders of russia this is just one of the infrastructure projects that will bring quick economic returns it includes freight so all investment will be paid off very quickly and will contribute to these regionsí development  the volume of transit shipments on our railways must grow almost fourfold this means that russia will become a global leader in transit shipping between europe and asia  in  the ports of the soviet union had an aggregate capacity of  million tonnes but after the country broke apart we lost almost half in the early  russian ports could handle only  million tonnes over the last  years this figure has tripled in early  the aggregate port capacity in russia exceeded  billion tonnes for the first time in history as you can see from the charts this exceeds the level reached by the soviet union by more than two thirds by the way these are the figures for early  and the capacity currently stands at  billion tonnes  we need to further expand this capacity including by increasing the capacity of railway links to ports in the azov and black sea basin  to  million tonnes  the northern sea route will be the key to developing the russian arctic and far east by  cargo traffic along this route will surge tenfold to  million tonnes our goal is to make it a truly global and competitive transport route let me remind you that the northern sea route was used more actively in soviet times compared to how we have been using it so far we will definitely develop this route and reach new horizons i have no doubt about it  we will continue our proactive policy to attract investment and create social and economic growth centres in russiaís far east we will create all the conditions to ensure a peoplefriendly living environment so that people move to this region and its population grows  a number of largescale industrial projects have been launched in the arctic they comply with the highest environmental standards we are strengthening the research transport navigation and military infrastructure which is expected to guarantee russiaís interests in this strategic region russia builds cuttingedge nuclear icebreakers we have had the most powerful icebreaker fleet in the world and this will remain so  we will renovate and expand the network of regional airports across russia in six years half of the regions will be connected between each other by direct flights the situation where you had to make a connection in moscow when flying to a neighbouring region will become a thing of the past we are already working on this this includes efforts to develop aviation and airports  the spatial development strategy will serve as a foundation for preparing a comprehensive plan to modernise and expand the backbone traffic infrastructure i believe this to be a priority for the future government  russia must not just become the worldís key logistics and transport hub but also which is very important a global centre for the storage processing transfer and reliable protection of large volumes of information socalled big data  overall infrastructure development must take into account global technological changes in other words the projects we are now considering must include practical solutions for combining infrastructure with drones and digital marine and air navigation as well as use ai to streamline logistics  likewise we must introduce new technologies for the generation storage and relay of energy in the next six years we plan to attract some  trillion rubles in private investment for modernising our power generation sector all power systems throughout the country must convert to digital technology we must use the socalled distributed generation method to supply electricity to remote areas  by  highspeed internet will be available throughout the country we will complete the construction of fibre optic lines in the majority of populated areas with a population of more than  people small remote towns in the extreme north siberia and the russian far east will access internet via a network of russian satellites  we will use advanced telecommunications to give our people access to the digital world as we know this is more than just modern services online education and telemedicine although all this is very important more than that people will be able to use digital space to conduct research organise volunteer and project groups or run companies in our vast country this combination of talent competencies and ideas amounts to a huge groundbreaking resource  colleagues  a crucial task facing every one of us is to make advanced highquality healthcare widely accessible we must be guided by the highest international standards in this area  in  we need to spend over  percent of the gdp each year to develop the healthcare system at the same time the goal we must bear in mind is  percent in absolute terms this means that healthcare spending must double in addition we must find new funding opportunities that would not limit economic growth  i would like to thank doctors paramedics and nurses for their difficult and highly necessary work a great deal depends on these people as well as on teachers counsellors and cultural workers and they must receive decent salaries  we have done a lot to implement the  may executive orders i must say that there were several failures but overall despite the demanding targets of these orders without them we would not have had the results we can see today we must always set ambitious tasks  we must not lose the positions we have already attained i am referring to the level of wages wages in the public sector must continue growing as well as the quality of work and skills of the people working in healthcare education and other areas that define peopleís wellbeing  in recent years we have optimised the hospital network in the country this was done in order to build an effective healthcare system however in some case i have to say this today too many administrative changes were introduced hospitals in small towns and villages have been closed no one proposed an alternative and people were left with practically no medical aid the only advice they were given was ìgo to the city to get treatment thereî i must say that this is unacceptable they forgot about the main thing the people their interests and needs equal opportunities and justice  this must not happen in healthcare or any other area we must provide or restore where necessary easy access to primary healthcare we can do this but we should have done this from the very beginning when we started the reforms  this must be done as quickly as possible in the period from  to  we must ensure that each small town with a population of  to  people has a paramedic station and an outpatient clinic for villages with less than  people ñ we also have villages as small as that ñ we will organise mobile medical units allterrain vehicles with all the necessary diagnostic equipment  these projects should be closely monitored i consider them extremely important and i also ask the russian popular front to stay in contact with people to keep an eye on the situation on the ground at the same time outpatient clinics and paramedic stations regional healthcare facilities and leading medical centres should be linked into a single digital network so that the entire national healthcare system is involved in helping each person  disease prevention is a vitally important task in the  this work was largely neglected we began to restore it we need to provide all people with a real opportunity to have a complete physical at least once a year this is also important for encouraging a responsible attitude to ones own health  modern diagnostics will reduce mortality among the working age population and consolidate the positive trends in treating cardiovascular disorders we can see these positive trends which is very good but we also need to fight other threats such as cancer  colleagues i think that practically every one of us has relatives or friends or friends of friends afflicted with this disease ñ cancer i propose to implement a special national cancer programme to involve scientists and the national pharmaceutical industry to modernise oncological centres to build a modern system from early diagnosis to timely effective treatment that will protect people we have positive experience in this area we must reach the cuttingedge the highest level of all the key indicators that show the effectiveness of cancer care ñ experts should know what they are  colleagues  medical assistance alone is not enough to protect public health we must also ensure high standards of environmental safety across russia  a long a healthy life is hard to achieve when millions of people drink substandard water when we see black snow as it happened in krasnoyarsk and when people in large industrial centres such as cherepovets nizhny tagil chelyabinsk or novokuznetsk do not see the sun for weeks on end  we have tightened environmental requirements for companies which should reduce industrial pollution starting in   industrial enterprises with a negative impact on the environment must convert to the best available environmentally friendly technology and all enterprises in the high environmental risk group must do this starting in   we had a go at this problem many times and every time our companies complained about the difficulties involved there is no going back now i want everyone to know that we will not delay this programme any longer  we also need to modernise our thermal power plants boiler houses and utility services build bypass routes to ease transit traffic congestion in large cities as well as use lowimpact public service vehicles the authorities and public volunteers have reported some  landfill sites we must address this problem as a priority starting with the removal and reclamation of landfill sites within city limits  we must seriously improve the quality of drinking water in some small towns water is only available for several hours a day we must use defence industry technologies to settle these problems  we will launch conservation projects for the unique natural systems of lake baikal and lake teletskoye as well as the entire volga basin which will help improve living conditions for nearly half of russiaís population  we will establish  new nature reserves and natural parks they should be open for ecotourism which is important for encouraging a caring and responsible attitude to nature  colleagues  the year  in russia has been declared the year of volunteers it is highly symbolic that the year started with the adoption of a law whereby authorities at all levels were tasked with assisting volunteers today proactive and concerned citizens and sociallyminded npos contribute to addressing crucial issues it is the involvement of the people in national affairs and their civic engagement as well as cultural moral and spiritual values that make us a single people capable of achieving ambitious goals  it is essential that we preserve our identity in the era of major technological shifts in this regard culture has a key role to play as a national civilisational code that can unlock the human creative potential  i propose launching a programme to establish cultural educational and museum complexes in the regions they will offer concert venues drama music and dance schools and other creative institutions as well as exhibition spaces where the countryís leading museums can display their treasures why store so many works of art in museum warehouses i am talking about centres of culture that would be open to young people and people of all ages the first project of this kind will be carried out in vladivostok and other regions and cities across russia will be selected at a later time  colleagues our children want to see a forwardlooking russia you can find many sincere reflections along these lines in school essays having bold dreams always helps if you are seeking to achieve an ambitious goal we must help every child discover his or her talent and help them live up to their potential the future of russia is in its classrooms schools must respond to the current challenges in order for the country to do the same  international experts agree that russia has one of the best primary school systems in the world we will keep up our proactive efforts to develop general education at all levels let me emphasise that every child should have access to a quality education equal educational opportunities are a powerful driver in terms of promoting national development and social justice  we need to shift to completely new education methods including personalised learning in order to cultivate in our children a readiness for change and creative curiosity and teach them to work in teams which is very important in the modern world and other life skills applicable to the digital era we will absolutely support talented teachers who are motivated to pursue continuous professional growth and of course we need to build an open and modern system for school management selection and training school administrators are the ones in charge of building a strong faculty and productive morale  we will continue to enhance the comprehensive system to support and develop our childrenís creative skills and talents this system must extend to the entire country and incorporate the resources of such projects as sirius and quantorium as well as extracurricular education centres and childrenís creative centres all over russia  we need to build a modern career guidance system where schools partner with universities research groups and successful companies i propose starting a new early career guidance programme for schoolchildren ticket to the future from the next academic year the programme will allow kids to try out real jobs in major russian companies we will allocate  billion rubles for this project this year alone  i believe mentorship is another important aspect to improve only by bringing together advanced knowledge and moral foundations by ensuring a true partnership and mutual understanding between generations can we become stronger  colleagues today knowledge technology and expertise make the most important competitive advantages they are the key to a real breakthrough and improved quality of life  as soon as possible we need to develop a progressive legal framework and eliminate all barriers for the development and wide use of robotic equipment artificial intelligence unmanned vehicles ecommerce and big data processing technology and this legal framework must be continuously reviewed and be based on a flexible approach to each area and technology  we have all the resources to promptly implement  and internet of things technologies  we need to build our own digital platforms it goes without saying that they should be compatible with the global information space this would pave the way to reorganising manufacturing processes financial services and logistics including using blockchain technology which is very important when it comes to financial transactions property rights etc these initiatives have realworld application  we need to start making or localising key technologies and solutions including those used in developing the arctic and the sea shelf and building new energy transport and urban infrastructure systems this is also important in areas related to improving the quality of life such as cuttingedge rehabilitation tools for people with disabilities  it is our duty to support hightechnology companies offer startups a favourable environment and introduce new industrial solutions i am talking about a userfriendly infrastructure taxation systems technical regulations and venture financing  technological development should be firmly rooted in fundamental research over the recent years we have been able to expand research and are now leading in a number of areas the russian academy of sciences and russiaís leading research institutions made a major contribution to achieving this  building on the advances made in the preceding years including in developing the research infrastructure we need to take our research to a new level projects to build cuttingedge mega science research facilities are already underway in gatchina and dubna the council for science and education has adopted a decision recently to build a powerful synchrotron collider at the novosibirsk akademgorodok and a new generation collider in protvino moscow region  with these facilities russia will become one of the worldís leading countries in terms of the capability and performance of its research infrastructure these units will give a serious competitive edge to russian research teams and hightechnology companies for example for developing new medications materials and microelectronics  of course this infrastructure and ambitious research projects will not fail to attract our compatriots and researchers from abroad in this regard we need to create a legal framework that would enable international research teams to operate in russia  large research and education centres should begin working to full capacity they will integrate the possibilities of universities academic institutions and hightech companies such centres are already being set up in kazan and samara tomsk and novosibirsk yekaterinburg and tyumen vladivostok and kaliningrad and other cities  it is important to focus them on the implementation of major interdisciplinary projects including in such a promising field as genome research a cardinal breakthrough in this area will pave the way to developing new methods for diagnosing preventing and treating many diseases and will expand the selection possibilities in agriculture  we need to reinforce the superiority of the national mathematics school it gives russia a strong competitive edge in the age of digital economy international mathematics centres will also provide platforms for such work these are already operating in kazan and novosibirsk following the adopted decisions we will open more in st petersburg moscow and sochi  young russians are already proving their leadership in science and in other areas last year russian schoolchildren won  medals at international academic competitions our teams triumphantly won the olympiad in natural sciences and robotics the worldskills competition and our students showed the best results in programming for the twelfth time  based on the best practices and experience we need to quickly modernise the vocational education system achieve qualitative changes in the training of students especially in the advanced areas of technological development to establish the ëapplied bachelorí level in those vocational professions that actually require an engineering degree and also to organise centres for advanced professional retraining and professional growth  i also propose creating the most convenient and attractive conditions for talented young people from other countries to enrol at our universities they already come to study here but we also need to create conditions for the best foreign graduates of our universities to work in russia this fully applies to foreign scientists and qualified specialists  i think we need to seriously improve the procedure for granting russian citizenship the focus should be on the foreign nationals russia needs on young healthy and welleducated people for them we need to create a simplified system for obtaining russian citizenship  colleagues  to ensure breakthrough development and upgrade education healthcare and the quality of the urban environment and infrastructure it will be necessary to allocate considerable additional funds in the next six years for these purposes  question at what expense where do we get these funds first of all it is essential to clearly prioritise these tasks and enhance the efficiency of government spending it is necessary to involve private companies more actively in funding major projects the future government will have to establish new taxation rules as soon as possible they should be stable and fixed for the next few years  let me emphasise that we need such fiscal solutions that would ensure budget revenues at all levels and guarantee the implementation of all social commitments importantly they should encourage rather than impede economic growth it is the buildup of economic potential of the country and each of its regions that is the main source of additional resources to achieve this our economic growth rates should exceed those of the worldís this is a difficult task but not instance case of wishful thinking this is a fundamental condition for a breakthrough in resolving social infrastructure defence and other tasks the new government should set itself the goal of reaching such growth rates as its key guideline  in the last few years we have enhanced the sustainability of our economy the dependence of the economy on hydrocarbon prices has been substantially reduced we have increased our gold and currency reserves inflation has dropped to a record low level ñ just over two percent of course we all understand that the growth of prices for many basic necessities is much higher this should be strictly monitored by different agencies including the antimonopoly service but on the whole this low inflation level creates additional opportunities for development let me remind you that quite recently in  inflation was almost  percent ñ  percent to be exact  in effect russia has formed a new macroeconomic reality with low inflation and general economic sustainability for the people this is a condition for real income growth and cheaper mortgage loans for entrepreneurs it means predictability in business and cheaper loans business should also adapt to these new macroeconomic conditions finally it makes it possible to attract longterm loans and private investment into largescale infrastructure projects  now we have an opportunity without speeding up inflation and maintaining a careful and responsible approach to gradually cut interest rates and make loans more affordable i count on the support of the bank of russia in that while making its decisions implementing monetary policy measures and developing financial markets it will work in contact with the government in the interests of the common goal of creating a proper environment for increasing the economic growth rates  in order to further change the national economy structure and improve its competitiveness it is imperative to use the sources of growth at a fundamentally different level where are they first of all it is important to increase labour productivity on a new technological managerial and personnel basis we are still lagging noticeably behind in terms of this indicator  it is necessary to ensure that labour productivity in mediumsized and large enterprises of basic industries such as manufacturing construction transport agriculture and trade grows at a rate of at least  percent per year which will allow us to reach the level of the leading world economies by the end of the next decade  i want to emphasise that increasing productivity is also about higher wages and hence increased consumer demand in turn this constitutes an additional driver for economic growth  all our actions should push companies to produce technically complex products and to implement more efficient technologies it is necessary to make an inventory of subsidies and other instruments for direct support of industries and to target them on making competitive goods  increased investment is the second source of growth we have already set the task of bringing it up to  percent of the gdp and then to  percent unfortunately this goal has not been achieved yet to ensure sustainable growth we need to do so at all costs i hope that the new government in conjunction with the bank of russia will present a concrete plan of action in this area  investment should be primarily used for upgrading and technologically reequipping the industries and retrofitting the manufacturing industry we need to ensure the highest dynamics here to reach a level where on average every second enterprise within a year carries out technological changes that is when the renewal effort in the economy and industry will be noticeable  promoting small businesses is the third largescale reserve of economic growth by the middle of the next decade their contribution to the countrys gdp should approach  percent and the number of employed there should grow from  million to  million people  one of the main problems facing entrepreneurs is access to financial resources there is a government programme in place for small production businesses that offers loans with only  percent interest i think this programme must continue overall this support mechanism must become widely available  finally another source of growth is the development of nonresource exports it is necessary to remove all administrative barriers and create the most favourable conditions for the companies entering foreign markets  within the next six years we must double the amount of nonresource and nonenergy exports to reach  billion ñ specifically increase machine engineering exports to  billion exports of services including education healthcare tourism and transport must reach  billion per year  in the early  we were deeply dependent on food imports the situation has turned around completely now we are on the verge of more changes in just four years from now we plan to be supplying more food to global markets than we will be importing from abroad we need to increase exports of meat and highadded value products as well as to make the country more selfsufficient in beef milk and vegetable supplies  i want to stress that development of the agricultural industry is strongly related to commodity production however this development must not be at the expense of small farms and their workers we must support family businesses and farmers we will develop cooperative agriculture and create conditions for residents of rural areas to increase their income every now and then we hear about problems with peopleís interests being affected i am aware of them such cases must be taken very seriously  nevertheless i want to say thank you to the agricultural industry workers for the recordbreaking harvest of  million tonnes note that it is more than the record harvest in the soviet union in  the ussr produced  million tonnes now it is common for russia to exceed  million tonnes  clearly such a large harvest has a downside as well the prices have gone down there are some storage and transport issues we have established discount rates on transporting crops by railway until july   to support our producers  it is necessary to consider extending this measure to the next harvesting seasons as well as to arrange additional deliveries to the urals siberia and the regions far away from ports we must help those who want and can process crops locally added value needs to be increased then we can go into the livestock industry with this product we will certainly discuss these and other problems reported by agricultural workers at the agricultural producersí forum in march and will elaborate on additional measures to support the industry  colleagues  in order for the economy to operate at its full capacity we need to radically improve the business climate and guarantee entrepreneurial freedom and competition  let me highlight a fundamental point in this regard the state must gradually reduce its share in the economy in this connection it has to be noted that the state has taken over a number of financial assets in an effort to revive the banking sector these initiatives are headed in the right direction and have my support that said these assets should be put on the market and sold without delay  we need to get rid of everything that enables corrupt officials and law enforcement officers to pressure businesses the criminal code should not serve as a tool for settling corporate disputes these should be referred to administrative and arbitration courts  i ask the working group on monitoring and analysing law enforcement practice in entrepreneurial activity together with the supreme court law enforcement agencies the prosecutorís office and representatives of the business community to draft specific proposals on this subject this matter should not be approached in a lightminded manner all the proposals must undergo careful examination and approval and this should be done as soon as possible  at the same time criminal law should be strictly enforced in the case of offences infringing upon the interests of citizens or society or violating economic freedoms i am referring to offences against property and assets held by citizens illegal takeovers competition law violations tax evasion and embezzlement of public funds  i would now like to move on to another important subject while the number of various inspections seems to be declining during meetings with businesses i often hear that radical change has yet to materialise the presence of inspectors at enterprises should become the exception and be limited to highrisk facilities otherwise remote monitoring methods can be used the entire control and oversight system should move to a riskoriented approach within two years let me remind you that the relevant legislative framework is already in place  it is important to support startup entrepreneurs to help people take the first step so that they can open their own businesses with just one click make the compulsory payments receive services and loans online  sole proprietors and selfemployed individuals who use digital services generally need to be freed from reporting and allowed to pay taxes via a simple transaction in automatic mode as for businesses that use cash register equipment their tax reporting needs to be simplified you know this is just a routine issue at first glance but this tedious routine is what prevents us from moving forward vigorously we need to do everything to clean out this space i will add that the intensive introduction of digital technologies and platforms will allow us to make consistent progress towards greater transparency and away from shadow economy  now i would like to address all representatives of russian business those who run their own small business a family enterprise or a farm an innovative company or a large industrial enterprise i know i know we still have a lot to do and i assure you we will do everything to give our entrepreneurs new opportunities to expand production to open businesses and to create modern jobs but at the same time i expect that russian business will increase its contribution to the countrys breakthrough development and respect for entrepreneurial work in society will grow it is very important  colleagues we need to build modern services for business but this is not all the system for interaction between the state and society between the state and the people should be clear and understandable convenient and comfortable  we have already set up a network of multifunctional centres a person anywhere in the country can now use public services as a onestopshop allow me to remind you that it was a special programme which we have developed and implemented  we need to move forward to ensure the provision of virtually all public services in real time via remote services within six years all document circulation between state agencies should be digitised which is important both for the state agencies and for citizens so as not to browse the internet for hours looking for information it will be possible to get everything in one place i will add that digitalisation of the entire public administration system and its greater transparency is also a powerful factor in fighting corruption  government officials of all levels should be interested in improving their efficiency and be strictly focused on obtaining concrete results by the way we are always talking about corruption and officials i have to say and i do not have the right to not say this the vast majority of our public servants are honest decent and goaloriented people however what i said will help everyone including government officials and users of government services this line of thinking should be used to rebuild the public service system where appropriate and to introduce project work methods  of course it is necessary to ensure the advancement of modern professional personnel in the government and municipal service business the economy science and industry in all spheres  as you may be aware the first leaders of russia competition took place and a number of other projects are being implemented to support young workers entrepreneurs innovators volunteers schoolchildren and students they brought together hundreds of thousands of young people from all regions and became an important step in their lives and professional careers  i want to emphasise for all those who want to work show themselves and are ready to honestly serve the fatherland and the people and to succeed russia will always be a country of opportunity this is the guarantee of our successful development and confident movement forward  all the projects and the priorities that i mentioned today such as spatial development investment in infrastructure education healthcare the environment innovative technologies and research measures to support the economy to promote talent the youth all of this is designed to work for one strategic task ñ russiaís breakthrough development  at the same time we cannot forget about reliably ensuring its security  colleagues  the operation in syria has proved the increased capabilities of the russian armed forces in recent years a great deal has been done to improve the army and the navy the armed forces now have  times more modern weapons over  new units of equipment were put into service the strategic missile troops received  new intercontinental ballistic missiles  submarinelaunched ballistic missiles and three borei nuclearpowered ballistic missile submarines twelve missile regiments have received the new yars intercontinental ballistic missile the number of longrange highprecision weapons carriers has increased by  times while the number of guided cruise missiles increased by over  times the army the aerospace forces and the navy have grown significant stronger as well  both russia and the entire world know the names of our newest planes submarines antiaircraft weapons as well as landbased airborne and seabased guided missile systems all of them are cuttingedge hightech weapons a solid radar field to warn of a missile attack was created along russiaís perimeter it is very important huge holes appeared after the ussr disintegrated all of them were repaired  a leap forward was made in the development of unmanned aircraft the national defence control centre was established and the operational command of the far maritime zone was formed the number of professional service members has increased by  times and the availability of equipment in the armed forces grew from  percent to  percent the yearslong queue for permanent housing was eliminated and the waiting period was cut by  percent  now on to the most important defence issue  i will speak about the newest systems of russian strategic weapons that we are creating in response to the unilateral withdrawal of the united states of america from the antiballistic missile treaty and the practical deployment of their missile defence systems both in the us and beyond their national borders  i would like to make a short journey into the recent past  back in  the us announced its withdrawal from the antiballistic missile treaty russia was categorically against this we saw the sovietus abm treaty signed in  as the cornerstone of the international security system under this treaty the parties had the right to deploy ballistic missile defence systems only in one of its regions russia deployed these systems around moscow and the us around its grand forks landbased icbm base  together with the strategic arms reduction treaty the abm treaty not only created an atmosphere of trust but also prevented either party from recklessly using nuclear weapons which would have endangered humankind because the limited number of ballistic missile defence systems made the potential aggressor vulnerable to a response strike  we did our best to dissuade the americans from withdrawing from the treaty all in vain the us pulled out of the treaty in  even after that we tried to develop constructive dialogue with the americans we proposed working together in this area to ease concerns and maintain the atmosphere of trust at one point i thought that a compromise was possible but this was not to be all our proposals absolutely all of them were rejected and then we said that we would have to improve our modern strike systems to protect our security in reply the us said that it is not creating a global bmd system against russia which is free to do as it pleases and that the us will presume that our actions are not spearheaded against the us  the reasons behind this position are obvious after the collapse of the ussr russia which was known as the soviet union or soviet russia abroad lost  percent of its national territory  percent of its population  of the gdp  percent of its industrial potential nearly half of our potential i would underscore as well as  percent of its military capability due to the division of the soviet armed forces among the former soviet republics the military equipment of the russian army was becoming obsolete and the armed forces were in a sorry state a civil war was raging in the caucasus and us inspectors oversaw the operation of our leading uranium enrichment plants  for a certain time the question was not whether we would be able to develop a strategic weapon system some wondered if our country would even be able to safely store and maintain the nuclear weapons that we inherited after the collapse of the ussr russia had outstanding debts its economy could not function without loans from the imf and the world bank the social sphere was impossible to sustain  apparently our partners got the impression that it was impossible in the foreseeable historical perspective for our country to revive its economy industry defence industry and armed forces to levels supporting the necessary strategic potential and if that is the case there is no point in reckoning with russiaís opinion it is necessary to further pursue ultimate unilateral military advantage in order to dictate the terms in every sphere in the future  basically this position this logic judging from the realities of that period is understandable and we ourselves are to blame all these years the entire  years since the withdrawal of the united states from the antiballistic missile treaty we have consistently tried to reengage the american side in serious discussions in reaching agreements in the sphere of strategic stability  we managed to accomplish some of these goals in  russia and the us signed the new start treaty containing measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms however in light of the plans to build a global antiballistic missile system which are still being carried out today all agreements signed within the framework of new start are now gradually being devaluated because while the number of carriers and weapons is being reduced one of the parties namely the us is permitting constant uncontrolled growth of the number of antiballistic missiles improving their quality and creating new missile launching areas if we do not do something eventually this will result in the complete devaluation of russiaís nuclear potential meaning that all of our missiles could simply be intercepted  despite our numerous protests and pleas the american machine has been set into motion the conveyer belt is moving forward there are new missile defence systems installed in alaska and california as a result of natoís expansion to the east two new missile defence areas were created in western europe one has already been created in romania while the deployment of the system in poland is now almost complete their range will keep increasing new launching areas are to be created in japan and south korea the us global missile defence system also includes five cruisers and  destroyers which as far as we know have been deployed to regions in close proximity to russiaís borders i am not exaggerating in the least and this work proceeds apace  so what have we done apart from protesting and warning how will russia respond to this challenge this is how  during all these years since the unilateral us withdrawal from the abm treaty we have been working intensively on advanced equipment and arms which allowed us to make a breakthrough in developing new models of strategic weapons  let me recall that the united states is creating a global missile defence system primarily for countering strategic arms that follow ballistic trajectories these weapons form the backbone of our nuclear deterrence forces just as of other members of the nuclear club  as such russia has developed and works continuously to perfect highly effective but modestly priced systems to overcome missile defence they are installed on all of our intercontinental ballistic missile complexes  in addition we have embarked on the development of the next generation of missiles for example the defence ministry and enterprises of the missile and aerospace industry are in the active phase of testing a new missile system with a heavy intercontinental missile we called it sarmat  sarmat will replace the voevoda system made in the ussr its immense power was universally recognized our foreign colleagues even gave it a fairly threatening name  that said the capabilities of the sarmat missile are much higher weighing over  tonnes it has a short boost phase which makes it more difficult to intercept for missile defence systems the range of the new heavy missile the number and power of its combat blocs is bigger than voevodaís sarmat will be equipped with a broad range of powerful nuclear warheads including hypersonic and the most modern means of evading missile defence the high degree of protection of missile launchers and significant energy capabilities the system offers will make it possible to use it in any conditions  could you please show the video  video plays  voevodas range is  km while sarmat has practically no range restrictions  as the video clips show it can attack targets both via the north and south poles  sarmat is a formidable missile and owing to its characteristics is untroubled by even the most advanced missile defence systems  but we did not stop at that we started to develop new types of strategic arms that do not use ballistic trajectories at all when moving toward a target and therefore missile defence systems are useless against them absolutely pointless  allow me to elaborate on these weapons  russias advanced arms are based on the cuttingedge unique achievements of our scientists designers and engineers one of them is a smallscale heavyduty nuclear energy unit that can be installed in a missile like our latest  airlaunched missile or the american tomahawk missile ñ a similar type but with a range dozens of times longer dozens basically an unlimited range it is a lowflying stealth missile carrying a nuclear warhead with almost an unlimited range unpredictable trajectory and ability to bypass interception boundaries it is invincible against all existing and prospective missile defence and counterair defence systems i will repeat this several times today  in late  russia successfully launched its latest nuclearpowered missile at the central training ground during its flight the nuclearpowered engine reached its design capacity and provided the necessary propulsion  now that the missile launch and ground tests were successful we can begin developing a completely new type of weapon a strategic nuclear weapons system with a nuclearpowered missile  roll the video please  video plays  you can see how the missile bypasses interceptors as the range is unlimited the missile can manoeuvre for as long as necessary  as you no doubt understand no other country has developed anything like this there will be something similar one day but by that time our guys will have come up with something even better  now we all know that the design and development of unmanned weapon systems is another common trend in the world as concerns russia we have developed unmanned submersible vehicles that can move at great depths i would say extreme depths intercontinentally at a speed multiple times higher than the speed of submarines cuttingedge torpedoes and all kinds of surface vessels including some of the fastest it is really fantastic they are quiet highly manoeuvrable and have hardly any vulnerabilities for the enemy to exploit there is simply nothing in the world capable of withstanding them  unmanned underwater vehicles can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads which enables them to engage various targets including aircraft groups coastal fortifications and infrastructure  in december  an innovative nuclear power unit for this unmanned underwater vehicle completed a test cycle that lasted many years the nuclear power unit is unique for its small size while offering an amazing powerweight ratio it is a hundred times smaller than the units that power modern submarines but is still more powerful and can switch into combat mode that is to say reach maximum capacity  times faster  the tests that were conducted enabled us to begin developing a new type of strategic weapon that would carry massive nuclear ordnance  please play the video  video plays  by the way we have yet to choose names for these two new strategic weapons the globalrange cruise missile and the unmanned underwater vehicle we are waiting for suggestions from the defence ministry  countries with high research potential and advanced technology are known to be actively developing socalled hypersonic weapons the speed of sound is usually measured in mach numbers in honour of austrian scientist ernst mach who is known for his research in this field one mach is equal to  kilometres per hour at an altitude of  kilometres the speed of sound is mach  speeds between mach  and mach  is called supersonic and hypersonic is above mach  of course this kind of weapon provides substantial advantages in an armed conflict military experts believe that it would be extremely powerful and that its speed makes it invulnerable to current missile and air defence systems since interceptor missiles are simply put not fast enough in this regard it is quite understandable why the leading armies of the world seek to possess such an ideal weapon  friends russia already has such a weapon  the most important stage in the development of modern weapons systems was the creation of a highprecision hypersonic aircraft missile system as you already know for sure it is the only one of its kind in the world its tests have been successfully completed and moreover on december  of last year these systems began their trial service at the airfields of the southern military district  the unique flight characteristics of the highspeed carrier aircraft allow the missile to be delivered to the point of discharge within minutes the missile flying at a hypersonic speed  times faster than the speed of sound can also manoeuvre at all phases of its flight trajectory which also allows it to overcome all existing and i think prospective antiaircraft and antimissile defence systems delivering nuclear and conventional warheads in a range of over  kilometres we called this system kinzhal dagger  video please  video plays  but this is not all i have to say  a real technological breakthrough is the development of a strategic missile system with fundamentally new combat equipment – a gliding wing unit which has also been successfully tested  i will say once again what we have repeatedly told our american and european partners who are nato members we will make the necessary efforts to neutralise the threats posed by the deployment of the us global missile defence system we mentioned this during talks and even said it publicly back in  after the exercises of the strategic nuclear forces when the system was tested for the first time i said the following at a meeting with the press it is embarrassing to quote myself but it is the right thing to say here  so i said as other countries increase the number and quality of their arms and military potential russia will also need to ensure it has new generation weapons and technology  in this respect i am pleased to inform you that successfully completed experiments during these exercises enable us to confirm that in the near future the russian armed forces the strategic missile forces will receive new hypersonicspeed highprecision new weapons systems that can hit targets at intercontinental distance and can adjust their altitude and course as they travel this is a very significant statement because no country in the world as of now has such arms in their military arsenal end of quote  of course every word has a meaning because we are talking about the possibility of bypassing interception boundaries why did we do all this why did we talk about it as you can see we made no secret of our plans and spoke openly about them primarily to encourage our partners to hold talks let me repeat this was in  it is actually surprising that despite all the problems with the economy finances and the defence industry russia has remained a major nuclear power no nobody really wanted to talk to us about the core of the problem and nobody wanted to listen to us so listen now  unlike existing types of combat equipment this system is capable of intercontinental flight at supersonic speeds in excess of mach   as i said in  in moving to its target the missiles gliding cruise bloc engages in intensive manoeuvring – both lateral by several thousand km and vertical this is what makes it absolutely invulnerable to any air or missile defence system the use of new composite materials has made it possible to enable the gliding cruise bloc to make a longdistance guided flight practically in conditions of plasma formation it flies to its target like a meteorite like a ball of fire the temperature on its surface reaches – degrees celsius but the cruise bloc is reliably guided  play the video please  video plays  for obvious reasons we cannot show the outer appearance of this system here this is still very important i hope everyone understands this but let me assure you that we have all this and it is working well moreover russian industrial enterprises have embarked on the development of another new type of strategic weapon we called it the avangard  we are well aware that a number of other countries are developing advanced weapons with new physical properties we have every reason to believe that we are one step ahead there as well – at any rate in the most essential areas  we have achieved significant progress in laser weapons it is not just a concept or a plan any more it is not even in the early production stages since last year our troops have been armed with laser weapons  i do not want to reveal more details it is not the time yet but experts will understand that with such weaponry russias defence capacity has multiplied  here is another short video  video plays  those interested in military equipment are welcome to suggest a name for this new weaponry this cuttingedge system  of course we will be refining this stateoftheart technology obviously there is far more in development than i have mentioned today but this is enough for now  i want to specifically emphasise that the newly developed strategic arms – in fact new types of strategic weapons – are not the result of something left over from the soviet union of course we relied on some ideas from our ingenious predecessors but everything i have described today is the result of the last several years the product of dozens of research organisations design bureaus and institutes  thousands literally thousands of our experts outstanding scientists designers engineers passionate and talented workers have been working for years quietly humbly selflessly with total dedication there are many young professionals among them they are our true heroes along with our military personnel who demonstrated the best qualities of the russian army in combat i want to address each of them right now and say that there will absolutely be awards prizes and honorary titles but because i have met many of you in person many times i know you are not after awards the most important thing is to reliably ensure the security of our country and our people as president and on behalf of the russian people i want to say thank you very much for your hard work and its results our country needs them so much  as i have already said all future military products are based on remarkable advances that can should and will be used in hightechnology civilian sectors i would like to stress that only a country with the highest level of fundamental research and education developed research technology industrial infrastructure and human resources can successfully develop unique and complex weapons of this kind you can see that russia has all these resources  we will expand this potential and focus on delivering on the ambitious goals our country has set itself in terms of economic social and infrastructure development effective defence will serve as a guarantee of russias longterm development  let me reiterate that each of the armament systems i referred to is uniquely important even more importantly taken together all these advances enable the defence ministry and general staff to develop a comprehensive defence system in which every piece of new military equipment will be assigned a proper role on top of strategic weapons that are currently on combat alert and benefit from regular updates russia will have a defence capability that would guarantee its security in the long term  of course there are many things that we have to do in terms of military construction but one thing is already clear russia possesses a modern hightechnology army that is quite compact given the size of the territory centred on the officer corps who are dedicated to their country and are ready to sacrifice anything for its people sooner or later other armies will also have the technology the weapons even the most advanced ones but this does not worry us since we already have it and will have even better armaments in the future what matters is that they will never have people or officers like the russian pilot major roman filipov  i hope that everything that was said today would make any potential aggressor think twice since unfriendly steps against russia such as deploying missile defences and bringing nato infrastructure closer to the russian border become ineffective in military terms and entail unjustified costs making them useless for those promoting these initiatives  it was our duty to inform our partners of what i said here today under the international commitments russia had subscribed to when the time comes foreign and defence ministry experts will have many opportunities to discuss all these matters with them if of course our partners so desire  for my part i should note that we have conducted the work to reinforce russias defence capability within the current arms control agreements we are not violating anything i should specifically say that russias growing military strength is not a threat to anyone we have never had any plans to use this potential for offensive let alone aggressive goals  we are not threatening anyone not going to attack anyone or take away anything from anyone with the threat of weapons we do not need anything just the opposite i deem it necessary to emphasise and it is very important that russias growing military power is a solid guarantee of global peace as this power preserves and will preserve strategic parity and the balance of forces in the world which as is known have been and remain a key factor of international security after wwii and up to the present day  and to those who in the past  years have tried to accelerate an arms race and seek unilateral advantage against russia have introduced restrictions and sanctions that are illegal from the standpoint of international law aiming to restrain our nations development including in the military area i will say this everything you have tried to prevent through such a policy has already happened no one has managed to restrain russia  now we have to be aware of this reality and be sure that everything i have said today is not a bluff ‒ and it is not a bluff believe me ‒ and to give it a thought and dismiss those who live in the past and are unable to look into the future to stop rocking the boat we are all in and which is called the earth  in this connection i would like to note the following we are greatly concerned by certain provisions of the revised nuclear posture review which expand the opportunities for reducing and reduce the threshold for the use of nuclear arms  behind closed doors one may say anything to calm down anyone but we read what is written and what is written is that this strategy can be put into action in response to conventional arms attacks and even to a cyberthreat  i should note that our military doctrine says russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons solely in response to a nuclear attack or an attack with other weapons of mass destruction against the country or its allies or an act of aggression against us with the use of conventional weapons that threaten the very existence of the state this all is very clear and specific  as such i see it is my duty to announce the following any use of nuclear weapons against russia or its allies weapons of short medium or any range at all will be considered as a nuclear attack on this country retaliation will be immediate with all the attendant consequences  there should be no doubt about this whatsoever there is no need to create more threats to the world instead let us sit down at the negotiating table and devise together a new and relevant system of international security and sustainable development for human civilisation we have been saying this all along all these proposals are still valid russia is ready for this  our policies will never be based on claims to exceptionalism we protect our interests and respect the interests of other countries we observe international law and believe in the inviolable central role of the un these are the principles and approaches that allow us to build strong friendly and equal relations with the absolute majority of countries  our comprehensive strategic partnership with the peoples republic of china is one example russia and india also enjoy a special privileged strategic relationship our relations with many other countries in the world are entering a new dynamic stage  russia is widely involved in international organisations with our partners we are advancing such associations and groups as the csto the shanghai cooperation organisation and brics we are promoting a positive agenda at the un  and apec we are interested in normal and constructive cooperation with the united states and the european union we hope that common sense will prevail and our partners will opt for honest and equal work together  even if our views clash on some issues we still remain partners because we must work together to respond to the most complex challenges ensure global security and build the future world which is becoming increasingly interconnected with more and more dynamic integration processes  russia and its partners in the eurasian economic union seek to make it a globally competitive integration group the eaeus agenda includes building a common market for electricity oil petroleum products and gas harmonising financial markets and linking our customs authorities we will also continue to work on a greater eurasian partnership  colleagues this is a turning period for the entire world and those who are willing and able to change those who are taking action and moving forward will take the lead russia and its people have expressed this will at every defining moment in our history in just  years we have undergone changes that took centuries in other countries  we will continue to confidently chart our own course just as we always have we will stick together as we always have our unity is the most durable foundation for future progress in the coming years it is our goal to further strengthen this unity so that we are one team that understands that change is necessary and is ready to devote its energy knowledge experience and talent to achieving common goals  challenges and big goals give special meaning to our lives we must be bold in our plans and actions take responsibility and initiative and grow stronger which means being of use to our families children the whole country changing the world and our country for the better and creating the russia that we all dream about only then will the next decade and the entire  century undoubtedly be an age of outstanding triumphs for russia and our shared success i believe it will be so  thank you 
Trudeau,before i begin it wont surprise you that my remarks today will address the importance of progressive values in the context of globalization  on that note today i am pleased to announce that canada and the ten other remaining members of the transpacific partnership concluded discussions in tokyo japan on a new comprehensive and progressive agreement for transpacific partnership cptpp  the agreement reached in tokyo today is the right deal our government stood up for canadian interests and this agreement meets our objectives of creating and sustaining growth prosperity and wellpaying middleclass jobs today and for generations to come  we are pleased with the progress we have made to make this deal more progressive and stronger for canadian workers on intellectual property culture and the automotive sector‎  trade helps strengthen the middle class but for it to work we must ensure that the benefits are shared with all our citizens not just the few the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership is a new step on that path  i would also like to personally thank ‎prime minister abe for hosting the recent talks and for his leadership on reaching this positive outcome  je suis heureux dannoncer aujourdhui que le canada et les dix autres membres de laccord de partenariat transpacifique global et progressiste ont conclu leurs négociations àtokio  cet accord est un bon accord pour les canadiens car il créera de lemploi et de la prospérité pour la classe moyenne  nous sommes fiers dêtre arrivés à un accord unanime avec tous les partenaires sur la culture et davoir réalisé du progrès pour le secteur automobile et la propriété intellectuelle  grâce à nos efforts continus nous avons un accord ambitieux et progressiste pour les canadiens  today is a great day for canada and a great day for progressive trade  i was last here at the world economic forum in  two months after being sworn in as prime minister  and while that might not seem like very long ago in this new era of perpetual change that were living in two years might as well be a lifetime  think about it the pace of change has never been this fast yet it will never be this slow again  theres enormous opportunity and enormous potential in that realization  technology has always brought such promise – a better standard of living new innovations remarkable products consider that progression from steam power to electricity to computers  but it also brings dramatic shifts in our social economic and political cultures  this current step involving automation and ai as the obvious examples will totally revolutionize the world of work – in many ways they already have  as business leaders i know you view these as both exciting and challenging advancements you are rightly anxious about how quickly our existing business models are being disrupted  still if youre anxious imagine how the folks who arent in this room are feeling  workers people who arent seeing the benefits of economic growth regular men and women who are trying to grab a rung on the career ladder never mind climb it – for them technology is a benefit to their lives but a threat to their jobs  over the past few years weve seen the ripple effects of economic uncertainty and inequality play out around the world  the unrest weve witnessed is driven by anxiety and fear  fear of what a rapidly changing world means for workers and their families and for those who are already struggling in the existing economy  and that fear – that anxiety – is valid  people have been taken advantage of losing their jobs and their livelihoods  governments and corporations – we havent done enough to address this  over the past decades citizens and workers have been calling for change but too often their pleas have been ignored  too many politicians become disconnected – refusing to really listen chasing short term wins over long term meaningful solutions  and too many corporations have put the pursuit of profit before the wellbeing of their workers  the gap between the rich and the poor is staggering  all the while companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other  but that approach cant and wont cut it anymore  les gens se sentent à lécart ils sont fâchés et ils blâment les secteurs public et privé  nous sommes témoins dun moment important – nous ne pouvons pas répéter les erreurs du passé  la croissance économique doit générer des retombées réelles pour nos communautés  les accords commerciaux doivent tous les jours offrir de meilleures occasions à nos citoyens  et les entreprises doivent prendre au sérieux leurs obligations à légard des travailleurs qui sont à leur service et à légard des communautés qui les appuient  were in a new age of doing business – you need to give back  you need to be part of the solution and if you dont believe me take it from larry fink  in his most recent annual letter to ceos larry writes  society is demanding that companies both public and private serve a social purpose  to prosper over time every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society  companies must benefit all of their stakeholders including shareholders employees customers and the communities in which they operate  now i understand that the burden of change falls heavy and you cannot be expected to solve all the ills of the world  but sitting back and hoping some other corporation – or some other country –volunteers to take the lead on this will get us nowhere  we have to drive this change each and every one of us  forums like this one are a great way to talk about how we can best work together to fulfill our duty to serve  we cannot neglect our responsibility to the people who matter most – to the people who arent here in davos and never will be  those are the people were working for  those are the people who must be our priority  if we do nothing and if we operate in the mindset of business as usual the systems will break down and we will all fail  we all know that to be competitive in the modern economy change is imperative  and the grassroots desire for change is there – it always has been  but its on us to flip the switch  we know what needs to be done it is well past time that we listen learn and finally lead  of course this kind of profound societal change can seem overwhelming and lead us to wonder where even to begin  so id like to focus on a fundamental shift that every leader in this room can act on immediately  one that i have made a central tenet of my leadership  one that is core to this years forum thanks to the leadership of our seven extraordinary cochairs  im talking about hiring promoting and retaining more women  and not just because its the right thing to do or the nice thing to do but because its the smart thing to do  in canada like all over the world much of the economic and labour force growth weve experienced over the last many decades is because of women entering into – and changing – the workforce  but there is still so much room for improvement and such enormous benefit to be had  mckinsey estimates that narrowing the gender gap in canada could add  billion to our economy by   research tells us that organizations with women on their corporate boards and in key leadership positions perform better than those without  in fact the peterson institute for international economics found that increasing the share of women in leadership positions from  to  translates into a  boost to profitability  recent estimates suggest that economic gender parity could add  trillion to the united states gdp  and in china  the gdp boost could be as much as  trillion – thats bigger than the entire canadian economy  mesdames et messieurs embaucher promouvoir et retenir plus de femmes se traduit non seulement par une augmentation de vos profits mais aussi par une plus grande diversité didées  en effet linclusion des femmes a le pouvoir damener linnovation à un autre niveau et de faciliter la résolution des conflits  encouragez la participation des femmes et vos entreprises tout comme vos communautés seront plus fortes  now when we talk about getting more women into the workforce the issue of pay equity comes up – and it should its vitally important  in canada well be moving forward this year with legislation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value at the federal level  but im sure there are a few of you in the audience who are thinking i already have equal pay policies in place this doesnt apply to me  so while i commend your effort on this front it may not be good enough  our own governments pay equity efforts while important are still just a first step  because equal pay for women does not mean equal opportunity or equal treatment or equal sacrifice  paying a female employee the same as a male employee doesnt even begin to touch issues around family planning promotions or job security  women do more parttime work and more unpaid work than men  how do we address that  when we dig a little deeper when we peel back that outer layer we see that there are a whole host of barriers facing women in the workplace  removing these barriers will take effort leadership and a willingness to change the nature of work as we know it  questce que ça veut dire que pouvonsnous faire comment accroître la représentation des femmes au sein des entreprises et surtout comment faire pour les maintenir en poste  eh bien nous devons fondamentalement changer la culture dentreprise de façon à ce que les femmes se sentent accueillies soutenues et valorisées  heres where we need to start  its time to take a serious look at parental leave and child care policies  we should be encouraging women – and men – to make the best decision for their family situation  in canada weve given parents more options for parental leave and invested billions in affordable high quality child care  we also introduced a really successful child benefit program that gives middle and lowincome parents more money every month to help with the high costs of raising kids  and since the canada child benefit gives more money to those who need it most the financial impact on single mothers ‎has been significant  last year nearly  of single moms receiving the canada child benefit earned less than  and received about  in total benefits taxfree  and lets be clear helping those families has been a key driver of canadas recent economic growth  companies should have a formal policy on gender diversity and make the recruitment of women candidates a priority  you may remember that we introduced our countrys first genderbalanced cabinet in   the usual suspects complained but guess what  two years later chrystia freeland and maryam monsef who are here this week – along with their many female colleagues in cabinet – are serving the country with great distinction and have elevated the level of decisionmaking and debate for everyone in cabinet and in government  as corporate leaders consider a genderbalanced board or genderbalanced project teams  anytime were looking for a new hire we should be identifying women candidates at a rate equal to men  in canada when we look to fill appointments we work to recruit people who reflect the true diversity of our country  et nous devons rendre les comptes sur les efforts que nous déployons de façon ouverte et transparente  en fait nous sommes sur le point dadopter une loi qui obligerait les entreprises constituées en vertu dune loi fédérale à divulguer de linformation au sujet de leurs politiques en matière de diversité  par exemple cela inclurait la proportion hommes‑femmes de leur conseil dadministration et de leur haute direction  quelques autres points à améliorer  nous devons comprendre que la responsabilité de prendre soin des aînés ou des proches malades revient souvent aux femmes  alors la création dun programme pour les aidants naturels qui contribuerait à réduire les difficultés financières engendrées par une absence au travail est une option à envisager  and we have to recognize that aspects of intersectionality are always at play and require special attention  heres an example in  among women who were newly appointed to the boards of fortune  companies  of them were white  race religion sexuality socioeconomic status – these are just a few of the ways that women are even further discriminated against  and finally folks here is a really big one  me too times up the womens march – these movements tell us that we need to have a critical discussion on womens rights equality and the power dynamics of gender  sexual harassment for example – in business and in government – is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable  as leaders we need to act to show that truly time is up  we must each have a wellunderstood established process in place to file allegations of workplace harassment  and when we receive those complaints we must take them seriously  as women speak up it is our responsibility to listen and more importantly to believe  folks treat these not as piecemeal alternatives to how things currently run treat these examples as a fundamental essential shift in the way we operate  as governments and corporations are entrusted with a platform and a voice lets use them  last year with our neighbours in the us we established the canadaus council for advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders  the council just put out an important report – their first of five – focused on supporting and growing womenowned businesses  cette année le canada préside le  dont le sommet aura lieu dans charlevoix au québec  lavancement des femmes sur les plans social politique et économique est un aspect important de notre présidence  légalité des sexes et lanalyse comparative entre les sexes seront intégrés dans lensemble des thèmes des activités et des résultats de notre présidence du  – y compris dans les réunions ministérielles et lors du sommet des dirigeants du   et je suis heureux dannoncer que melinda gates et isabelle hudon seront les coprésidentes du conseil consultatif pour légalité des sexes du   ces deux femmes sont des voix fortes pour lavancement de légalité des sexes et lautonomisation des femmes et des filles – et sassureront que légalité des sexes demeure une priorité dans tout ce que nous faisons au  cette année  im pleased to announce that the cochairs for the  gender equality advisory council will be melinda gates and isabelle hudon  both of these women are global leaders in the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls – and so will ensure that gender equality is a priority through everything the  does this year   will also see canada hosting fortunes most powerful women international summit and  will bring the women deliver conference to vancouver – the worlds largest gathering on health rights and wellbeing of women and girls  these are just a few examples of what were doing to draw regular and frequent attention to the untapped potential of women and girls around the world  and thats not to say that weve got it all figured out  in canada we need more women in politics more women on corporate boards and more women in stem  and thats just the tip of the iceberg  so in reflecting on this let me ask you what are your challenges and what are you doing to address them  ladies and gentlemen the hiring promotion and retention of women is something we can make happen today right now  more women in leadership positions wont just grow our economy create jobs and strengthen our communities  it will also lead to innovation and change in the workplace – innovation and change that workers so desperately need  the unrest that we see around the world is palpable and it isnt going away  these are uncertain times we have a responsibility to address peoples very real concerns  and the only way well get there is by listening if we listen to our workers and our citizens we will create solutions that actually stick  the people in this room are immensely privileged – we owe it to society to use this privilege for good  we should ask ourselves – do we want to live in a world where the wealthy hide in their gated enclaves while those around them struggle  or do we want to help create a world grounded in the notion of fairness  because right now we are in real danger of leaving to our kids a world that is less fair than the one we inherited from our parents  and i know we can do so much better  progress of any kind takes hard work  but by thinking big and working together we will build a better world  thank you 
Trump,madam speaker mr vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states and my fellow americans  we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential as we begin a new congress i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans  millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation  the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda it is the agenda of the american people  many of us campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nations infrastructure to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts americas interests first  there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage to seize it victory is not winning for our party victory is winning for our country  this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of americas mission and the power of american pride  in  we also celebrate  years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo  astronauts who planted that flag buzz aldrin this year american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets  in the  century america saved freedom transformed science and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the  century an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach  we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before  but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good  together we can break decades of political stalemate we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future the decision is ours to make  we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction  tonight i ask you to choose greatness  over the last  years my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades  in just over  years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before we have created  million new jobs and importantly added  new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started  we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit  we virtually ended the estate or death tax on small businesses ranches and family farms  we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed right to try  my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations  we have unleashed a revolution in american energy — the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and now for the first time in  years we are a net exporter of energy  after  months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth and america is winning each and every day members of congress the state of our union is strong our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before  on friday it was announced that we added another  jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected an economic miracle is taking place in the united states — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations  if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesnt work that way  this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than  highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and to our country  now is the time for bipartisan action believe it or not we have already proven that it is possible  in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic va reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans  and just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson i was deeply moved in  alice was sentenced to life in prison as a firsttime nonviolent drug offender over the next two decades she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path she had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond  alices story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice she served almost  years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life  in june i commuted alices sentence — and she is here with us tonight alice thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny  when i saw alices beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did the right thing  inspired by stories like alices my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the africanamerican community the first step act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive lawabiding citizens now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption  as we have seen when we are united we can make astonishing strides for our country now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis  the congress has  days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure our southern border  now is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business  as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection i have ordered another  troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught  this is a moral issue the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well‑being of all americans we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways i want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally  tonight i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country  no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards  meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools and hospitals increased crime and a depleted social safety net  tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country  tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl  the savage gang  now operates in  different american states and they almost all come through our southern border just yesterday an  gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border theyre going to keep streaming back in  year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens  ive gotten to know many wonderful angel moms dads and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured  here tonight is debra bissell just three weeks ago debras parents gerald and sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they were in their eighties and are survived by four children  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharons granddaughter heather and great‑granddaughter madison  to debra heather madison please stand few can understand your pain but i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again  not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border  in the last  years our brave ice officers made  arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly  assaults  sex crimes and  killings  we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes ice special agent elvin hernandez when elvin was a boy he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic at the age of eight elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking elvin says if i can make sure these young girls get their justice ive done my job thanks to his work and that of his colleagues more than  women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than  sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year  special agent hernandez please stand we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement — and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice  my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border  it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built ill get it built  this is a smart strategic seethrough steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need and as these agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way down  san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country in response and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings  the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nations most dangerous cities now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities  simply put walls work and walls save lives so lets work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe  as we work to defend our peoples safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace  no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women who have filled  percent of the new jobs created in the last year all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before  democratic female congress members state of the union cheer wear white democratic female members of congress cheer after president donald trump said there are more women in congress than ever before during this state of the union address on february   as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere this thursday we are launching the first ever governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries  to build on our incredible economic success one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies  we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end  therefore we recently imposed tariffs on  billion of chinese goods — and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime but i dont blame china for taking advantage of us — i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen i have great respect for president xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with china but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american jobs  another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta  i have met the men and women of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta for years politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal but no one ever tried — until now  our new usmexicocanada agreement — or usmca — will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words made in the usa  tonight i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us  both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of americas crumbling infrastructure  i know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future this is not an option this is a necessity  donald trump president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address on tuesday the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with preexisting conditions  already as a result of my administrations efforts in  drug prices experienced their single largest decline in  years  but we must do more it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it  i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients we should also require drug companies insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down  no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids scientific breakthroughs have brought a oncedistant dream within reach my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within  years together we will defeat aids in america  tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind the fight against childhood cancer  joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave  girl grace eline every birthday since she was  grace asked her friends to donate to st jude childrens research hospital she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself last year grace was diagnosed with brain cancer immediately she began radiation treatment at the same time she rallied her community and raised more than  for the fight against cancer when grace completed treatment last fall her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read last day of chemo grace — you are an inspiration to us all  many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades my budget will ask the congress for  million over the next  years to fund this critical lifesaving research  to help support working parents the time has come to pass school choice for americas children i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child   to defend the dignity of every person i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the lateterm abortion of children who can feel pain in the mothers womb  let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of god  the final part of my agenda is to protect americas national security  over the last  years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military — with  billion last year and  billion this year we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato — but now we have secured a  billion increase in defense spending from nato allies  as part of our military buildup the united states is developing a stateoftheart missile defense system  under my administration we will never apologize for advancing americas interests  for example decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities while we followed the agreement to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty  perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we cant – in which case we will outspend and outinnovate all others by far  as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in  months if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one and chairman kim and i will meet again on february  and  in vietnam  two weeks ago the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and its new interim president juan guaido  we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair  here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country america was founded on liberty and independence – not government coercion domination and control we are born free and we will stay free tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country  one of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east  our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress for this reason my administration recognized the true capital of israel — and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem  our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost  years in afghanistan and iraq nearly  american heroes have given their lives more than  americans have been badly wounded we have spent more than  trillion in the middle east  as a candidate for president i pledged a new approach great nations do not fight endless wars  when i took office isis controlled more than  square miles in iraq and syria today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers  i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict  in afghanistan my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups including the taliban as we make progress in these negotiations we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counterterrorism we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war the hour has come to at least try for peace  above all friend and foe alike must never doubt this nations power and will to defend our people eighteen years ago terrorists attacked the uss cole — and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack  we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley whose son navy seaman craig wibberley was one of the  sailors we tragically lost tom we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole  my administration has acted decisively to confront the worlds leading state sponsor of terror the radical regime in iran  to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal and last fall we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country  we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people we must never ignore the vile poison of antisemitism or those who spread its venomous creed with one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs  just months ago  jewishamericans were viciously murdered in an antisemitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer timothy has just had his  surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight officer matson we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil  tonight we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps today is judahs  birthday judah says he can still remember the exact moment nearly  years ago after  months in a concentration camp when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp suddenly the train screeched to a halt a soldier appeared judahs family braced for the worst then his father cried out with joy its the americans   i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on dday in the second world war one of them was herman zeitchik but there is more to hermans story a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth almost  years later herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated sidebyside here in the home of american freedom herman and joshua your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation  when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of dday  they were just young men of  and  hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war  they did not know if they would survive the hour they did not know if they would grow old but they knew that america had to prevail their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn  why did they do it they did it for america — they did it for us  everything that has come since — our triumph over communism our giant leaps of science and discovery our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before  think of this capitol — think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery to build the railroads and the highways to defeat fascism to secure civil rights to face down an evil empire  here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history  what will we do with this moment how will we be remembered i ask the men and women of this congress look at the opportunities before us our most thrilling achievements are still ahead our most exciting journeys still await our biggest victories are still to come we have not yet begun to dream  we must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them  we must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans we do the incredible we defy the impossible we conquer the unknown  this is the time to reignite the american imagination this is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens as neighbors as patriots  this is our future — our fate — and our choice to make i am asking you to choose greatness  no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together  we must keep america first in our hearts we must keep freedom alive in our souls and we must always keep faith in americas destiny — that one nation under god must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world  thank you god bless you god bless america and good night

Yoshihide_Suga,i am truly delighted to meet you all students of the vietnamjapan university vju which is a symbol of human resource development projects between japan and asean  vju was established based on an agreement between the leaders of japan and vietnam it is a symbol of japanasean cooperation especially the training and education of the next generation of global talents i am greatly honored to deliver a speech on my first overseas visit after taking office as prime minister in front of you who are studying here to go on to eventually forge the future of vietnam asean and the world  a month ago i took office as prime minister taking over the position of former prime minister abe shinzo who resigned due to his health issues former prime minister abe devoted himself to advancing japanasean relations including by establishing the vju i too would like to continue deepening the friendship and cooperation with the people of asean  please allow me to introduce myself a little bit in the hope that you may find something congenial in me in the same way i feel a strong affinity with your country and asean  i hear that it snows in the northern part of vietnam but you would be surely surprised to see snowfall in my hometown that is akita prefecture located in the northern part of japan it is an area where it snows so heavily that snow can pile up even higher than the first story of a house i was born and brought up as a son of a farmer in the deep snows of akita  after graduating from high school i moved to tokyo to challenge myself and began working at a small factory however i was soon faced with the harsh reality figuring that i could not change my life without university education i entered a university two years later than my peers perhaps my feelings at that time were similar to yours as you study and prepare for bounds and leaps in your future  i worked parttime to earn my living and academic fees upon graduating from university i worked in the private sector however realizing that it might be politics that is steering this country i entered the world of politics at the age of  which was  years ago  after serving as secretary for a member of the diet for eleven years i became a member of a local assembly at the age of  confronted with the need to change national politics to develop rural areas i aspired to enter national politics and became a member of the diet when i was   subsequently i became a cabinet minister and served as chief cabinet secretary under former prime minister abe and assumed the office of prime minister last month  ever since entering politics i have always thought about how best to improve peoples lives in any way i can and have worked hard at it with the support of many people as a result i have come thus far to shoulder the formidable responsibilities as the prime minister of japan leading the cabinet working for the people  come to think of it the path i have carved out as a politician may be akin to the one japan has taken in the postwar period starting from zero and achieving growth through diligent efforts at the same time the path may be somewhat likened to the trajectory of asean asean has achieved remarkable growth and become the center of global growth this explains why i feel a sense of affinity with your country and asean japan and asean helping each other as friends in asia asean and japan are equal partners and friends we support each other by working side by side learning from one another and working together in pursuit of growth our relationship remains exactly a hearttoheart relationship  this is amply illustrated by the recent response to the  pandemic following the outbreak of  supply chains were cut short around the world leaving many countries suffering from shortages of medical supplies japan also ran short of medical supplies and as chief cabinet secretary i exerted myself to secure supplies and distribute them on site  i was deeply moved when vietnam sent  million face masks to japan under such circumstances this cooperation symbolizes the strategic partnership between our countries  furthermore indonesia which is my next destination on this tour resumed exporting medical surgical clothing by exempting it from the application of an export ban despite being in a difficult situation amid the fight against  this is to my mind more proof of the resilience of the strategic partnership in which countries help each other in need  japan has been providing medical supplies and equipment in the form of grant aid and assisting human resource development with a view to contributing to strengthening health and medical care systems and improving public health in asean in addition at an unprecedented speed japan is implementing the  crisis response emergency support yen loans worth up to  billion yen over the next two years to support economic activities of countries with a focus on the indopacific region including asean these instances of cooperation also serve universal health coverage uhc a goal that japan has been striving for together with asean  moreover japan and asean are currently working together towards the establishment of the asean centre for public health emergencies and emerging diseases with the aim to strengthen aseans response capacity to infectious diseases  we have never forgotten how asean countries helped us as friends nine and a half years ago when the great east japan earthquake struck japan i believe that the ability to help each other in crises and respond swiftly to emerging challenges is another trait of the cooperation between japan and asean as equal partners improving connectivity hard and soft infrastructure and towards digital technology and the resilience of supply chains asean embraces diversity respects one another and emphasizes consensus japan believes that fully supporting asean which has moved forward with regional integration and developed in such spirit will lead to peace stability and prosperity in the region including japan based on this belief for the last several decades japan has been supporting aseans centrality and unity through a whole range of cooperation  the supply chain is an essential and integral element of modern day international business this trend was ushered in by the investment of japanese companies in asean japanese automobile manufacturers establishing factories in thailand in the  became the first of many investments made by a diverse range of japanese enterprises in asean  in this process japanese companies enhanced the expertise of their local employees in host countries through training and contributed to nurturing local businesses  as i see it the official development assistance oda in combination with investment from japanese companies have been instrumental in aseans sustainable development as if they were the two wheels of a cart  a typical example of oda cooperation is infrastructure development which enhances the connectivity of the region this means building social infrastructure conducive to economic growth such as ports roads railways airports and industrial compounds in an open manner and connecting them across national borders to form economic corridors examples of this cooperation include the eastwest economic corridor and the southern economic corridor running through vietnam laos cambodia thailand and myanmar japan will continue to support asean countries endeavors to strengthen mutual connectivity within the region and develop together as the entire region i am delighted that collaboration between japan and asean is still continuing in laying foundations for the asean economy which is vital to japanese companies as well  on the basis of such physical connectivity japan and asean are also jointly engaging in rulemaking towards strengthening of the international economic system taking on the challenge to improve connectivity of soft infrastructure  after the turn of the  century during rapid globalization rulemaking on trade and investment had made little headway due to stalled wto round negotiations  this prompted japan and asean to reduce trade barriers by concluding bilateral economic partnership agreements starting with the japansingapore economic partnership agreement and the aseanjapan comprehensive economic partnership ajcep and also to pursue rulemaking on regional economic activities  looking forward the key word for further improving connectivity is digital technology and the resilience of supply chains  first digital technology today digital technology and data transcend national borders connect economies and influence all kinds of social activities we will facilitate rulemaking based on data free flow with trust or dfft while promoting jointly with asean countries the digitalization of our economies and societies and the enhancement of digital connectivity all of which have grown in significance through responses to the  pandemic  the aseanjapan cybersecurity capacity building centre established in bangkok two years ago by japans cooperation contributes to safeguarding regional cyberspace together and to creating economies that enable companies to do business safely  next the resilience of supply chains the  pandemic once again shed light on the necessity to lower risks of cutoffs build a sustainable supply system and enhance its resilience in order to maintain international supply chains this is the reason why many japanese companies are striving to diversify supply chains by extending them to asean japan will further strengthen cooperation with asean to increase the resilience of supply chains and build economies in asia that are resilient to crises human resource development through personal interaction that further solidifies partnerships connectivity to be created by asean and japan is underpinned by the human resources of asean infrastructure and systems only work with the people who operate them  because asean has been nurtured in an environment rich in diversity and internationality it is abundant with human resources envied by the world to contribute to the development of human resources japan has been working in tandem with asean to assist capacity building through the exchange of people including jica experts japan overseas cooperation volunteers jocv training in japan and japanese government scholarship students an excellent example of such human resource development is this vju which set up undergraduate courses starting this year in addition to the existing graduate courses at the same time human resources full of youth and vitality such as technical intern trainees coming from asean countries to japan have become crucial to the lives and the economy of japanese people  based on this situation two years ago as the chief cabinet secretary i spearheaded domestic regulation reform and made it possible for skilled personnel in  fields to work in japan this specified skilled worker scheme has been implemented since april  we are undertaking comprehensive measures at the workplace municipalities and in education so that japan will be chosen by foreign workers and creating an accepting environment which will invite you to conclude that you want to work in japan  i am convinced that this kind of relationship i just mentioned has been instrumental in reinforcing the partnership between asean and japan thanks to human interaction through the cultivation of human resources numerous japanese people became fond of asean i really hope that in the same way many people in asean have come to love japan  nobody understands better than me the importance of peopletopeople exchanges in my capacity as chief cabinet secretary i focused on an inbound tourism initiative as a pillar of the governments growth strategy and advocated for easing requirements for foreign visitors to obtain visas a reform that had been stalled due to red tape as a result of this reform the number of visitors to japan last year reached approximately  million growing nearly fourfold from  million in   furthermore my country has been carrying out the wa project to foster cultural exchange between japan and asean through fine arts and the japanese language i believe the project has created many fans of japan and motivated many to visit japan i am hoping to announce attractive cultural exchange projects to succeed the wa project on the occasion of the  anniversary of japanasean friendship and cooperation in   although visiting for tourism is difficult at present when the  pandemic is brought under control i sincerely hope that many people will be visiting both japan and asean to experience the diverse culture and the rich nature in each country and savor the delicious local cuisines  if the opportunity arises please also venture to the rural areas in japan i am sure you will find something new to enjoy  we still cannot be optimistic about the impacts caused by the  pandemic however for the sake of the global economy we must not halt crossborder travel while preventing the spread of infection starting october  japan recommenced accepting business persons for short business trips and international students and company employees for medium to long term stays from countries around the world including vietnam under certain conditions we will continue to create a system so that more and more people from countries successfully controlling infectious diseases including vietnam will be able to visit japan safely through simplified procedures  students of vju please come and visit japan for employment research business trips and other purposes asean outlook on the indopacific and japans free and open indopacific which share fundamental principles what brought about the wide range of cooperation between asean and japan i have outlined so far  i believe the key is that asean and japan fully share fundamental principles such as the rule of law openness freedom transparency and inclusiveness because these are deeply rooted in our societies asean and japan have been able to overcome obstacles and collaborate with each other  asean situated at the hub of the vast indian and pacific oceans released the asean outlook on the indopacific as a guide for its future path in  the asean outlook powerfully sets forth the rule of law openness freedom transparency and inclusiveness as the aseans principles for behavior the fact that it shares many fundamental commonalities with the free and open indopacific japan is advocating for is tremendously encouraging for me i strongly support the aoip i firmly believe that we can create a peaceful and prosperous future along with asean with these fundamental values in common  unfortunately in this region developments contrary to the rule of law and openness upheld by the asean outlook have been unfolding in the south china sea japan is strongly opposed to any actions that escalate tensions in the south china sea japan has been consistently supporting the preservation of the rule of law in seas i would like to reemphasize the importance for all parties concerning the south china sea issues to work towards the peaceful resolution of disputes based on international law instead of resorting to force or coercion  japan will work hand in hand with asean to establish the rule of law in seas and oceans for instance japan has provided patrol vessels and equipment for maritime safety to vietnam the philippines and other countries japan has also been advancing human resource development through training in and dispatch of experts to coastal nations along sea lanes including indonesia and malaysia japan will spare no effort to offer cooperation for this purpose conclusion i would like to conclude by reiterating my message today to all students present here my message is that if you work diligently with strong determination and are blessed with friends from whom you can learn similar to how japan and asean have each other you can grow side by side carve out your own path and follow that path towards achieving your respective goals i myself will exert every effort and treasure the invaluable friendship with asean as good friends let us put in the effort working hand in hand to move forward to accomplish a free open and more prosperous indopacific  thank you all for your kind attention
