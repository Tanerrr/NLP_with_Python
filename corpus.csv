Macron,dear friends we are here for this general assembly with the secretarygeneral having chosen what is such an important topic the climate and we had a meeting on this issue yesterday at a time when impatience is being expressed everywhere and when everything in the world around us – at any rate many things – might make us pessimistic climate we have not met our strict targets the goals we set ourselves in the battle against global warming and for biodiversity there are many tensions at an unprecedented level in certain areas of the world when you see what has happened again in the gulf over the past few days and when you see the challenges facing many of our friends here now particularly in the sahel – whose friendly faces i recognize here – and in so many other regions these conflicts are increasingly tough painful for civilians humanitarian personnel human rights defenders as david miliband says the age of impunity has dawned trade tensions are increasing and there are growing concerns about technological changes and their consequences i do not want to paint a pessimistic picture here and i know you are tired – you have been listening to many speeches since this morning – so i shall spare you the litany of reasons to despair nevertheless we have got everything we need to respond to these challenges – everything – and in an unprecedented way firstly we have got the knowledge never has world science come together in such a way to describe the challenges we have and anticipate the means of responding to them from the ipcc to ipbes to the extent that we are in the process of building on technological revolutions – this has been spelled out we know a little more each year we have got the finance which is not lacking worldwide we have got the capacity for unmatched innovation which on many of the issues i have talked about is also a means of responding to these challenges of fighting poverty of stabilizing of responding to the major changes i have just mentioned we have got an unprecedented awareness of these presentday ills  our young people when it comes to the climate or freedoms and i must say our public at large which has never been as informed as it is now and we have got a forum right here a forum of free states which recognize one another and are supposed to work for the common good and prepare the future of mankind respond to the current crises just as we have regional multilateral forums on many subjects or topics when we are dealing with trade or economic cooperation so what are we lacking how is it that speech after speech we make our peoples feel that we will not be able to respond to their fears thinking about it while i was preparing to address you i was reminded of a text which i have often thought back to solzhenitsyns harvard text from  on the decline in courage we lack courage a great deal of it frequently and basically today i simply wanted to tell you that i would like to launch an appeal for a return of courage on two subjects simply to begin with the courage to build peace and the courage to shoulder responsibility peacebuilding the courage to build peace first because we need courage to do it because building peace is about taking risks every time it involves not just defending ones basic interests or positions which have at times led to escalation or tensions in every area of the world building peace is about taking risks the risk of dialogue of compromise of rebuilding trust and in so many regions this is what we need it is what the middle east today needs it is what the gulf region needs courage is not about tensions provocations retaliations it is about a dialogue which sets high standards and is monitored transparently iran the first time i spoke to this assembly i said i firmly believed on iran that the strategy of exerting pressure visàvis the iran nuclear issue could lead only to a heightening of tensions in the region if it did not basically above all have a clear prospect of a diplomatic solution in  after the us pulled out of the  vienna agreement i proposed a comprehensive framework allowing us to protect the jcpoa and complement it with a wider approach enabling us to address the issues posed by the  iran nuclear programme irans role in regional crises and its ballistic programme what point have we reached today to americas strategy and the desire of europe russia and china to protect the  vienna agreement iran responded with a strategy of maximum pressure on its regional environment in this context tensions have risen constantly over the past few months and the attacks on  september against saudi arabia were a game changer following on from that today the risk is one of conflagration on the basis of a miscalculation or a disproportionate response peace is at the mercy of an incident which degenerates and the consequences for the whole region and beyond would be too serious to induce us to live on the brink of the abyss so what do we do i wholeheartedly believe that more than ever it is time for negotiations to be resumed between the united states of america iran the signatories to the jcpoa and the powers in the region first affected by its security and stability what must the terms the objectives of these negotiations be firstly complete certainty that iran never acquires nuclear weapons secondly an end to the crisis in yemen thirdly a regional security plan including the other crises in the region and the security of maritime traffic flows finally the lifting of economic sanctions i am not being naïve in any way and i do not believe in miracles either i believe in the courage of building peace and i know that the united states of america iran and all the signatories to the agreement have this courage it is with the same firm belief that we shall continue our work – discussed at length in recent weeks and during the  biarritz summit – on syria libya and the sahel syria on syria i want here to welcome yesterdays encouraging announcements made by the secretarygenerals special envoy and a decisive step forward in the formation at last of the longawaited constitutional committee we are all keeping a close eye on the humanitarian situation in idlib we are all committed to the stability of all syrias regions and to the protection of all its people and we shall continue working to build an inclusive lasting political solution in syria this has to involve the work of the constitutional committee at the same time syrian territory has to be made safe and secure so that refugees may return voluntarily and in complete safety it also has to involve a free electoral process which will have to include all syrian citizens libya with respect to libya the  summit reaffirmed our goals and our convictions i genuinely believe that we now strongly need an interlibyan conference on reconciliation and the strong commitment of the african union alongside the un in order to achieve this many initiatives have been taken i pay tribute to germanys commitment i pay tribute to the commitment of all stakeholders who want to build peace but lasting peace can only be built based on reconciliation between the libyan people sahel with respect to the sahel as you know frances commitment is unwavering and has been renewed here too the future depends on the development of lasting cooperation in the region between the five member countries of the  sahel the commitment of our armies un involvement and the need we now have to change minusmas mandate and to be able to fully integrate our goals – the fight against terrorism lasting security in the sahel – into the missions that we have given ourselves placing minusma under chapter vii mandate continuing to deploy all armed forces in the region recommitting all the security forces in the region to this fight against terrorism and devoting our energy to development and stabilization are essential these are all situations in which dialogue and the development of political solutions are key to success we have witnessed this courage to build peace take shape over the last few months in an unexpected inconceivable way in sudan thanks to the strength of the sudanese people thanks to the capacity for dialogue between the army and the people thanks here too to the work of the african union and the role of ethiopia whose vision and commitment throughout the region i wish to commend russiaukraine it is this same courage to build peace that is now required in ukraine president zelensky has taken the first steps president putin has responded to him progress has been made over the last few weeks we know our goals and the next steps the minsk accords and the capacity to finally build lasting peace on the ground in the next few weeks we will therefore have a summit in the normandy format at the level of heads of state and government multilateralism with respect to each of these issues the question we are asked each time is how can we recreate an effective framework for cooperation between states i think that it is possible i do not think that the problems we now have can be resolved by diluting responsibilities or by creating a form of globalization that overlooks the people and in this respect i agree with what president trump said this morning and i also do not think that the crises we are experiencing can be resolved more effectively by retreating into nationalism i truly believe in patriotism as long as it is based on love for ones country as well as universal aspirations i believe deeply in sovereignty as long as it is based on selfdetermination as well as on the need for cooperation what we need to do now is reinvent what i described in my last speech to you as strong multilateralism this doesnt mean that our multilateralism is tired that we are not listening to ourselves anymore that we are no longer effective no it means acknowledging that we will not find a solution by retreating into nationalism that we will not find a solution without cooperation this cooperation must however produce concrete results engage new stakeholders we have demonstrated the effectiveness of this strong modern multilateralism i think we did so with respect to climate when following the american decision to withdraw from the paris climate agreement we launched the one planet summit together with the un and the world bank this allowed us to preserve our cohesion to engage new stakeholders new investors and businesses we saw this again yesterday at the summit organized by the un where we engaged new actors generated momentum resisted disintegration in this respect the announcement yesterday of russias ratification of this same agreement is a form of success in terms of these initiatives what we have been able to achieve with the coalitions on numerous issues is also a sign of success this is the same strong pragmatic multilateralism that we adopted to combat terrorism on the internet through the aqaba process the christchurch call on  may in paris and i would like to pay tribute to the commitment of king abdullah ii of jordan and the prime minister of new zealand yesterday we marked a milestone  countries have joined this initiative platforms have been set up to handle operational protocols and remove terrorist content we will do more but we have a concrete genuine response we must continue to develop this capacity to move innovate respond to contemporary challenges this
Merkel,ladies and gentlemen nearly  years ago walter hallstein the former german commission president referred to european integration as an endeavour of unparalleled boldness the year was  ten years before the first direct european elections took place at the time the european community was still in its infancy many of our greatest accomplishments – schengen the single market and a single currency – were still mere visions but the foundation had been laid and with that after centuries marked by wars and dictatorships the citizens of europe for the first time held out hope for a sustainable peaceful and stable future today i am pleased and grateful to be standing in front of the largest democratic parliament in the world together you –  members elected in  member states – represent more than  million people that is nearly seven percent of the worlds population in your house we can feel the heart of european democracy beating the debates which are held in  languages are a sign of this your house also stands for another aspect of europe namely diversity it is one of our great strengths as europeans that we – time and again and despite our diversity – have allowed ourselves to be guided by a willingness to compromise despite our different origins and opinions we have so far always managed to arrive at solutions that benefit the community as a whole more than eleven years have passed since i first addressed this house at the time in  germany had assumed the presidency of the council of the european union in that speech i spoke about diversity as a unifying rather than dividing factor about freedom that constantly needs to be defended anew and about europe needing freedom the same way that people need air to breathe i also talked about a fundamental value that characterises europe – a value that brings freedom and diversity together in europe i spoke about tolerance i spoke about how tolerance is the soul of europe about how it is an essential fundamental value that defines european idea over the past eleven years we have also seen how much the world has changed – how if you will europes soul has been put to the test global political economic and technological challenges are developing at an ever greater pace and they are becoming more and more profound we have lived through a great public debt crisis the european union has not been spared the scourge of international terrorism wars and armed conflict are taking place only a few hours by plane beyond our doorstep global refugee and migration flows are also having a direct impact on us europeans the advance of digital technology is changing our way of life at breakneck speed we are feeling the effects of climate change old allies are calling tried and proven alliances into question the united kingdom will be the first country to exit the european union these days are marked by intensive negotiations and we more than ever are getting a sense of how deep that impact will be – i want to express my heartfelt thanks to michel barnier for his work members of this esteemed house – why am i saying this we all realise that predicting developments has become more difficult but we also realise something else the likelihood that interests can be asserted at global level by a single actor is steadily decreasing vice versa this means it is becoming ever more important for us europeans to take a united stance for this everyone in the european union must now more than ever show respect for others and their interests we must now more than ever have a common understanding that tolerance is the soul of europe that it is a key part of what makes us european and that only through tolerance can we develop a willingness to consider and fully identify with the needs and interests of others this will help us forge true european solidarity without which successful action is impossible this solidarity is built on tolerance it is the basis of our strength as europeans a strength that is unique in the world for three reasons firstly solidarity is a universal value standing up for one another is an essential prerequisite for every functioning society this holds true for families villages and sports associations as it does for a community such as the european union solidarity is a fundamental component of the european treaties it is an indispensable part of our system of values solidarity is encoded in our european dna we support countries and regions by promoting their economic development or assisting efforts to combat youth unemployment we help one another when natural disasters strike when terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents occur we stand by one another during the european public debt crisis we put together socalled rescue packages to help countries solve their economic and financial problems these few examples already show that the individual eu member states and thereby also the citizens of the european union are not left in the lurch during tough times and crises however these few examples also show that national decisions always also have an effect on the entire community therefore secondly solidarity always means that everyone must bear responsibility for the community as a whole specifically this means anyone who undermines ruleoflaw principles in their own country or who curtails rights of the opposition and civil society and restricts the freedom of the press thereby jeopardises the rule of law not only in his or her own country but for everyone in europe europe as a community of law can of course only function when the law applies – and is respected – equally everywhere anyone who seeks to solve problems only by taking on new debt or who ignores binding obligations also calls into question the foundation of a strong and stable euro area that is because our single currency can only function if every single member meets national obligations for sustainable finances anyone who undermines a unified european stance when interacting with third parties – regarding for example agreed sanctions or questions related to human rights – also undermines the credibility of european foreign policy as a whole because europe will only make its voice heard in the world if it stands united this means that showing solidarity always requires overcoming national egotisms i am well aware that germany has not always behaved well and that at times others take issue with its behaviour for example in the years before  it took us far too long also in germany to accept that the refugee issue concerns all eu member states and that it must be dealt with through a paneuropean approach from this it follows thirdly that solidarity that benefits all also ultimately and rightly understood means solidarity that is in everyones own best interest respecting and supporting others on the one hand and pursuing ones own interests on the other hand are not contradictory quite the opposite is true one example is our cooperation with african countries of origin in the sphere of refugees and migration – the president addressed this just a moment ago – this cooperation helps europe because it establishes more orderly controlled and reduced movements of refugees and migrants to europe at the same time it helps people in the countries of origin by improving their living conditions we can also prevent them from embarking on what is often a perilous journey to europe another example is europes commitment to worldwide climate protection these efforts are an ecological and social necessity for protecting the resources on which life depends – also for everyone here in europe europe benefits when industrialised and newly industrialising countries produce less greenhouse gasses and when all of our economies become greener what is more all europeans benefit when the euro area too develops harmoniously becoming a haven of strength and stability all europeans benefit when everyone joins in european civil protection efforts all europeans benefit when we help those who are most severely affected by displacement and migration it is a matter of tolerance that we respect the different reactions in the various member states when it comes to the question of taking in refugees – because each member state has its own history and demographic development however it is a matter of solidarity that we do everything in our power to find a common approach for tackling this and other challenges as a community these are hallmarks of europe solidarity as a universal fundamental value solidarity as a responsibility for the community and solidarity in terms of ones own rational interest ladies and gentlemen unity and common resolve are essential if europe is to succeed i therefore want to highlight three spheres that i think should be at the top of our agenda firstly there is our foreign and security policy we already now realise that we europeans are much better able to defend our interests whenever we act in concert only by taking a united stance will europe be strong enough to make its voice heard in the global arena and defend its values and interests its simply true that the times when we could fully rely on others have ended this means nothing other than that if we europeans want to survive as a community we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our own hands this means that in the long term europe must become more capable of taking foreign policy action we must therefore be ready to rethink our decisionmaking processes also by lifting the unanimity requirement wherever possible – that is in areas where this is permitted by the treaties i have proposed that we establish a european security council with rotating member state membership in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared we need to create a fully capable european military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis we have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain that is a good thing and these efforts have received wide support here yet – and i say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years – we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper european army yes thats how things stand four years ago jeanclaude juncker said a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries that would not be an army in competition with nato – dont misunderstand me – but it could be an effective complement to nato nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question but ladies and gentlemen it would then be much easier to cooperate with us when as is the case at the moment we have more than  defence or weapons systems and the united states has only  or  when each country needs its own administration support and training for everything we are not an efficient partner if we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives nothing speaks against us being colllectively represented in nato with a european army i dont see any contradiction there at all that would then also involve  heckling from the floor – i welcome that response that doesnt bother me im used to parliament – that incidentally would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within europe and it would also involve – this is a difficult task also for the federal republic of germany – developing a joint arms export policy because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world secondly ladies and gentlemen europes economic success is a crucial factor it forms the basis of our strength and determines whether our voice will even be heard in the world without economic clout we will
Nicolas_Maduro,ambassadors heads of delegations of the countries members of the united nations organization presidentelect of the general assembly mrs maria fernanda espinoza may i extend to you the congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the bolivarian republic of venezuela – our government – on assuming the presidency of the  session of the general assembly as the first latinamerican woman to be president of a general assembly session in this occasion we have been invited to work and address an important and vital issue entitled as follows making the united nations relevant to all people global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies so we are here to make the united nations relevant for all people this is precisely a noble purpose up to what the united nations system has to build in light of the  century a century of great opportunities and certainly a century that will make the difference regarding the human liberation processes – political liberation peoples liberation – that sooner or later will impact significantly on the future of the united nations organization the current united nations organization was born at the end of second world war  during the  century its configuration expressed the conflicts and forms of actions by the bipolar world of the postwar years and after the fall of the soviet union in the  we moved to a unipolar world the correlation of forces in the world regarding the world system has always influenced the united nations organization directly however in order to be relevant – according to the purpose of this  general assembly – this organization has to express the wishes the way of being the culture the political thinking the strength and the hopes of the majorities in the world that is why venezuela is here today to say its truth i bring the truth of a combative heroic and revolutionary world i bring the voice of a homeland that throughout history has refused to surrender to injustice to the empires of the past – slaver and colonialist – and the empires of today – equally slaver and neocolonialist i bring the voice of a heroic people that arose from the heroic resistance of the aborigines from the indigenous peoples that for centuries resisted the domination by colonial empires i bring the voice of the people having the honor of being the great liberator simon bolivars home the most important leader of a generation of liberators of the americas who accomplished  years ago the heroic feat of founding a continent a region a dream the independent republics of this world region venezuela is a historic people which is both a home and a school of republican values a home and a school of rebelliousness a home and a school of dignity and values such as equality such is our obstinate homeland that for centuries has searched its independence and sovereignty i speak on their behalf before this scenario which has witnessed the most evil and embarrassing attacks in the last years for our country is a harassed and attacked country yesterday in this same place the president of the united states of north america once again attacked the noble people of venezuela and supported as he said the doctrine founded by the empire of the united states  years ago which determined their interventionist role their intended role of judge party and police of the world the monroe doctrine yes the president of the most powerful imperial nation the united states of north america was in this same place supporting james monroes doctrine who at that time said america for americans meaning that the rest of america had to belong to them as the backyard for the interests of washington elite groups that already conducted the configuration of that nation as a former colony of the british empire he supported the monroe doctrine and you may be wondering about the reason for such fierce attack by the american power expressed at all levels by president donald trump it is a historic conflict as we have said to the world many times as our people well knows it is the conflict between the interventionist imperial neocolonialist monroe doctrine against the historic independence republican simon bolivars doctrine of rebelliousness dignity justice liberty and equality it is an old conflict an old contradiction due to an imperial doctrine aimed at dominating our region during the  century it was aimed at dominating our region only however in the  century it was intended to dominate the world and in the  century it tries to continue governing conducting blackmailing and arranging the world as if it were their property in our region it is a  contradiction between the republican libertarian flags which in the  century – the time of simon bolivar and the liberators – advocated for a world of equilibrium and respect and the pro imperialist and interventionist flags that promoted the domination of the region by an elite group that already had the control of the power in washington it is an old conflict we know very well today venezuela is a victim of a permanent aggression in the economic political diplomatic and media fields by those who govern the united states of north america and support the monroe doctrine to justify the ideological political and diplomatic aggression against our beloved homeland our reason for being here is the reason why is venezuela being politically economically and diplomatically attacked first of all venezuela has built an autonomous project of democratic revolution social vindication and construction of a self and new model of society which is based on the historical roots of our nation on the identity of our country and on the own culture of our latinamerican region for  years they have been intended to stop the course of our history the development of a revolutionary project that arose from the own struggle root of our people and region secondly – and perhaps more understandable for global geopolitical reasons venezuela is the nation with the largest oil reserve of the world internationally certified venezuela as founder of opec venezuela a country with  years of oil production discovered and certified internationally the largest oil richness of the world venezuela has also significant natural and mining richness today according to international standards our country is certifying the potentially biggest gold reserve of the world the world must know that currently apart from being the biggest international oil reserve venezuela is certifying under international standards the biggest gold reserve of the world and the fourth gas reserve of the world as well the significant natural resources important geopolitical geoeconomic and geostrategic position have lead the oligarchies of the continent and those who dominate from washington to consider dominating and controlling the political power in venezuela in the present venezuela is victim of a permanent aggression in the economic sphere during the last two years venezuela has been subjected to a set of illegal unilateral measures of economic persecution and blockade we have been restrained from using the international currency –the dollar via positions of use of dominion by the authorities of the us department of treasury currently venezuela cannot negotiate any international transaction in dollars did the world know that venezuela is persecuted from an economic commercial and monetary point of view today venezuela is target of a set of illegal and unilateral mechanisms of economic sanctions yesterday the president of the united states announced precisely on this same platform new and alleged economic and financial sanctions against our country in the sanctuary of the law and international legality did the united nations system know that the unilateral sanctions using the dominion the status of the currency and the financial persecution are considered illegal from the standpoint of international law venezuela is subjected to a permanent media aggression as well attempts to forge a file have been made to justify an international intervention we know that it is an intended international intervention a military intervention to control our country at global level a file has been forged through the media against our country to pretend a humanitarian crisis that uses the united nations concepts to justify a coalition of countries led by the government of the united states and their satellite governments in latin america to get its hands on our country a migration crisis that goes without saying has been forged by several means aimed at diverting the attention from the real migration crises in the world that show the disadvantages of the southern countries the migratory crisis in central america mexico and latin america arising due to the announcement of a retaining wall against our peoples a dividing wall against them nobody wants to talk about this situation a doublestandard treatment has been intended over the real status of the caribbean and latin american migrants who have been persecuted along the border with mexico they have been separated from their families their kids have been kidnapped and no response is given about this issue or about the serious migration crisis caused by the destruction in libya by nato and the war against syria resulting in the migration of thousands of african and middleeast brothers it is an issue that is intentionally masked a global media campaign about an alleged migratory crisis in venezuela has been deployed to justify a humanitarian intervention as announced for years it is a plan similar to the weaponof massdestruction plan used in iraq it is the same plan that justified the intervention in other countries this time under a form of a great brutal psychological warfare campaign today venezuela is also the victim of a diplomatic nature aggression yesterday – dear brothers and sisters of the governments of the world – we witnessed direct threats to cut aid to withdraw aid or blockade aid from the international support and aid systems for the governments and peoples of the world on the need of it by the president of the united states we have listened to the statements issued by several governments demanding better mechanisms to access financing to access development to which our peoples are entitled to yesterday the president of the united states in this very platform threatened the governments of the world to submit to its designs to its orders and to cooperate with its policies in the united nations system or he would act accordingly venezuela has been attacked with a fierce diplomatic offensive at all of the united nations system bodies supported by satellite kneeled governments blackening the honor of the peoples that they are called to represent venezuela has been subjected to permanent political aggression on september  the new york times published an article evidencing the participation of officials of the white house and the government of the united states in meetings to bring about a military coup and cause a change of government a change of regime in venezuela the investigation published by the new york times – replicated by the times magazine the washington post and the world press – simply confirmed the conspiracy the permanent aggression by factors of the government of the united states against a constitutional and strengthened democracy a democracy supported by the people such as the venezuelan democracy we had already denounced in due course the attempts of violence against the constitution the attempts of disturbances and military coups against the constitutional and revolutionary government over which i preside in the bolivarian republic of venezuela by popular will and popular vote after announcing and publishing the failed attempts of disturbances and military violence – the new york times published details on how us officials in colombia supported by the colombian government and colombian institutions met and offered their encouragement and support for this attempted change of regime should the united nations system should the union – i am addressing my latin american and caribbean brothers – should latin america and the
Obama,my fellow citizens i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition fortyfour americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land  a nagging fear that americas decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america  they will be met on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the godgiven promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the fainthearted  for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risktakers the doers the makers of things  some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions  that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act  not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technologys wonders to raise health cares quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them  that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works  whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the publics dollars will be held to account  to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day  because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control  and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart  not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expediences sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort  even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hardearned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes well work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus  and nonbelievers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their societys ills on the west  know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the worlds resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol faroff deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends  honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism  these things are old these
Putin,citizens of russia members of the federation council and state duma todays address is a very special landmark event just as the times we are living in when the choices we make and every step we take are set to shape the future of our country for decades to come it is at such turning points that russia has proven time and again its ability to develop and renew itself discover new territories build cities conquer space and make major discoveries this unwavering forwardlooking drive coupled with traditions and values ensured the continuity in the thousandyearlong history of our nation we have gone through major challenging transformations and were able to overcome new and extremely complex economic and social challenges preserved the unity of our country built a democratic society and set it on the path to freedom and independence we ensured sustainability and stability in almost all areas of life which is critical for a huge and multiethnic country like ours with its complex federative structure and diversity of cultures with historical divides that are still alive in peopleís memory and major challenges russia had to face over the course of its history however sustainability is the foundation of development but not its guarantee we have no right to allow a situation when the stability that has been achieved would lead to complacency all the more so as many problems remain unresolved today russia ranks among the worldís leading nations with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential but we have not yet reached the required level in the context of accomplishing our highly important task and guaranteeing peopleís quality of life and prosperity but we must do this and we will do this as i said in the past the stateís role and positions in the modern world are not determined only or predominantly by natural resources or production capacities the decisive role is played by the people as well as conditions for every individualís development selfassertion and creativity therefore everything hinges on efforts to preserve the people of russia and to guarantee the prosperity of our citizens we must achieve a decisive breakthrough in this area i repeat a solid foundation has been created for this therefore we can now set and accomplish new tasks we already have substantial experience in implementing ambitious programmes and social projects the russian economy has proved its resilience and the current stable macroeconomic situation opens up new opportunities for surging ahead and maintaining longterm growth finally the world is now accumulating a tremendous technological potential making it possible to achieve a real breakthrough in improving the peopleís quality of life and modernising the economy the infrastructure and state governance and administration how effectively we will able to use the colossal potentialities of the technological revolution and how we will respond to its challenges depends on us alone in this sense the next few years will prove decisive for the countryís future i reiterate these years will be decisive i will tell you why what i will say now has no connection to the domestic political cycle or even the presidential election no matter who is elected president each russian citizen and all of us together must be able to see what is going on in the world what is happening around us and what challenges we are facing the speed of technological progress is accelerating sharply it is rising dramatically those who manage to ride this technological wave will surge far ahead those who fail to do this will be submerged and drown in this wave technological lag and dependence translate into reduced security and economic opportunities of the country and ultimately the loss of its sovereignty this is the way things stand now the lag inevitably weakens and erodes the human potential because new jobs modern companies and an attractive life will develop in other more successful countries where educated and talented young people will go thereby draining the societys vital powers and development energy as i have said changes concern the entire civilization and the sheer scale of these changes calls for an equally powerful response we are ready to provide it we are ready for a genuine breakthrough my confidence is based on the results we have achieved together even though they may seem modest at first glance as well as on the unity of russian society and most importantly on the huge potential of russia and our talented and ingenious people in order to move forward and to develop dynamically we must expand freedom in all spheres strengthen democratic institutions local governments civil society institutions and courts and also open the country to the world and to new ideas and initiatives it is high time we take a number of tough decisions that are long overdue we need to get rid of anything that stands in the way of our development and prevents people from fully unleashing their potential it is our obligation to focus all resources and summon all our strength and willpower in this daring effort that must yield results otherwise there will be no future for us our children or our country it is not a question of someone conquering or devastating our land no that is not the danger the main threat and our main enemy is the fact that we are falling behind if we are unable to reverse this trend we will fall even further behind this is like a serious chronic disease that steadily saps the energy from the body and destroys it from within step by step quite often this destructive process goes unnoticed by the body we need to master creative power and boost development so that no obstacles prevent us from moving forward with confidence and independently we must take ownership of our destiny colleagues what should be our priority let me reiterate that i believe that the main key development factor is the wellbeing of the people and the prosperity of russian families let me remind you that in   million people lived below the poverty line which amounted to nearly  percent ñ  percent of the population in  this indicator fell to  percent poverty has increased slightly against the backdrop of the economic crisis today  million russian nationals live in poverty of course this is much fewer than the  million people in  but it is still way too many there are even working people who have to live very modest lives for the first time in our recent history the minimum wage was equated with the subsistence level this provision will come into force on may   and will benefit about  million people this is an important step but it still falls short of offering a fundamental solution we need to upgrade the employment structure that has become inefficient and archaic provide good jobs that motivate people improve their wellbeing and help them uncover their talents we need to create decent wellpaid jobs this would help deliver on one of the key objectives for the next decade which is to guarantee sustained longterm real income growth and to reduce the poverty rate by at least one half over the next six years it is our moral duty to provide allround support to members of the older generation who have made a tremendous contribution to national development senior citizens must have worthy conditions for a long active and healthy life most importantly we must raise pensions and index them regularly so that they outpace inflation we will also strive to reduce the gap between the size of pensions and preretirement wages and of course we must raise the quality of healthcare and social support for senior citizens and help people who are alone and those facing problems in life we need to address all these issues using a comprehensive approach as i see it the future new government will have to draft a special programme for the systematic support of senior citizens and for improving their quality of life we consider every person important and valuable people need to know that they are needed and they must live a long and healthy life and enjoy their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren they need to see their children grow up and become successful in a powerful rapidly developing and successful country that is attaining new development levels russia must firmly assert itself among the five largest global economies and its percapita gdp must increase by  percent by the middle of the next decade this is a very difficult task i am confident that we are ready to accomplish it of course life expectancy is a highly important fundamental parameter for gauging the wellbeing of citizens and the country in  russia posted a life expectancy of just over  years with menís life expectancy falling below  years this is not just low it is a tragedy and this parameter is tragically inadequate in the past few years russia has been posting a major increase in average life expectancy levels which is among the highest in the world we have managed to accomplish this task life expectancy levels have increased by over seven years and now total  years but of course this is not enough either today we must set an entirely new goal by the end of the next decade russia must confidently join the club of countries posting a life expectancy of  years which includes japan france and germany at the same time life expectancy levels for people living a healthy active and full life when they are not hampered and pinned down by illness must grow faster than planned i am confident that we can achieve this goal considering the positive trends of the previous years for this purpose the whole of russia will have to make a quantum leap in its development so that the life of every person is transformed colleagues we need to create a modern living environment and transform cities and villages across the country in doing so we must make sure that they preserve their identity and historical heritage we already have positive experience in renovating the urban environment and infrastructure let me elaborate on this point cities like kazan vladivostok and sochi have already benefited from upgrades of this kind change is underway in many regional capitals and smaller cities overall we now know how to do it i propose launching a largescale spatial development programme in russia which would include developing cities and other communities by at least doubling spending in this area over the next six years it is obvious that the effort to develop cities and other communities goes hand in hand with tihe need to overcome challenges in other areas including healthcare education environment and transport initiatives in all these segments will require additional funding i will talk about this matter further in my address urban renovation should be supported by the introduction of stateoftheart construction technology and materials modern architectural solutions digital technology for social services transport and utilities sectors among other things this would make the housing and utilities sector more transparent and efficient so that people receive quality services at a reasonable cost this largescale project brings the promise of better economic and social development prospects a modern living environment and a favourable climate for cultural and civil initiatives for small businesses and startups all this would facilitate the emergence of a large and creative middle class in russia of course a lot will depend on municipal and local authorities and whether they will be receptive to new ideas the ability to respond to the diverse needs of various generations including families with children retirees and people with disabilities will also be instrumental people must have a decisive say in the future of their cities and villages we have discussed this many times including at meetings with heads of municipalities today i am not saying it just to check the box
Trudeau,before i begin it wont surprise you that my remarks today will address the importance of progressive values in the context of globalization on that note today i am pleased to announce that canada and the ten other remaining members of the transpacific partnership concluded discussions in tokyo japan on a new comprehensive and progressive agreement for transpacific partnership cptpp the agreement reached in tokyo today is the right deal our government stood up for canadian interests and this agreement meets our objectives of creating and sustaining growth prosperity and wellpaying middleclass jobs today and for generations to come we are pleased with the progress we have made to make this deal more progressive and stronger for canadian workers on intellectual property culture and the automotive sector‎ trade helps strengthen the middle class but for it to work we must ensure that the benefits are shared with all our citizens not just the few the comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership is a new step on that path i would also like to personally thank ‎prime minister abe for hosting the recent talks and for his leadership on reaching this positive outcome today is a great day for canada and a great day for progressive trade i was last here at the world economic forum in  two months after being sworn in as prime minister and while that might not seem like very long ago in this new era of perpetual change that were living in two years might as well be a lifetime think about it the pace of change has never been this fast yet it will never be this slow again theres enormous opportunity and enormous potential in that realization technology has always brought such promise – a better standard of living new innovations remarkable products consider that progression from steam power to electricity to computers but it also brings dramatic shifts in our social economic and political cultures this current step involving automation and ai as the obvious examples will totally revolutionize the world of work – in many ways they already have as business leaders i know you view these as both exciting and challenging advancements you are rightly anxious about how quickly our existing business models are being disrupted still if youre anxious imagine how the folks who arent in this room are feeling workers people who arent seeing the benefits of economic growth regular men and women who are trying to grab a rung on the career ladder never mind climb it – for them technology is a benefit to their lives but a threat to their jobs over the past few years weve seen the ripple effects of economic uncertainty and inequality play out around the world the unrest weve witnessed is driven by anxiety and fear fear of what a rapidly changing world means for workers and their families and for those who are already struggling in the existing economy and that fear – that anxiety – is valid people have been taken advantage of losing their jobs and their livelihoods governments and corporations – we havent done enough to address this over the past decades citizens and workers have been calling for change but too often their pleas have been ignored too many politicians become disconnected – refusing to really listen chasing short term wins over long term meaningful solutions and too many corporations have put the pursuit of profit before the wellbeing of their workers the gap between the rich and the poor is staggering all the while companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other but that approach cant and wont cut it anymore were in a new age of doing business – you need to give back you need to be part of the solution and if you dont believe me take it from larry fink in his most recent annual letter to ceos larry writes society is demanding that companies both public and private serve a social purpose to prosper over time every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society companies must benefit all of their stakeholders including shareholders employees customers and the communities in which they operate now i understand that the burden of change falls heavy and you cannot be expected to solve all the ills of the world but sitting back and hoping some other corporation – or some other country –volunteers to take the lead on this will get us nowhere we have to drive this change each and every one of us forums like this one are a great way to talk about how we can best work together to fulfill our duty to serve we cannot neglect our responsibility to the people who matter most – to the people who arent here in davos and never will be those are the people were working for those are the people who must be our priority if we do nothing and if we operate in the mindset of business as usual the systems will break down and we will all fail we all know that to be competitive in the modern economy change is imperative and the grassroots desire for change is there – it always has been but its on us to flip the switch we know what needs to be done it is well past time that we listen learn and finally lead of course this kind of profound societal change can seem overwhelming and lead us to wonder where even to begin so id like to focus on a fundamental shift that every leader in this room can act on immediately one that i have made a central tenet of my leadership one that is core to this years forum thanks to the leadership of our seven extraordinary cochairs im talking about hiring promoting and retaining more women and not just because its the right thing to do or the nice thing to do but because its the smart thing to do in canada like all over the world much of the economic and labour force growth weve experienced over the last many decades is because of women entering into – and changing – the workforce but there is still so much room for improvement and such enormous benefit to be had mckinsey estimates that narrowing the gender gap in canada could add  billion to our economy by  research tells us that organizations with women on their corporate boards and in key leadership positions perform better than those without in fact the peterson institute for international economics found that increasing the share of women in leadership positions from  to  translates into a  boost to profitability recent estimates suggest that economic gender parity could add  trillion to the united states gdp and in china the gdp boost could be as much as  trillion – thats bigger than the entire canadian economy now when we talk about getting more women into the workforce the issue of pay equity comes up – and it should its vitally important in canada well be moving forward this year with legislation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value at the federal level but im sure there are a few of you in the audience who are thinking i already have equal pay policies in place this doesnt apply to me so while i commend your effort on this front it may not be good enough our own governments pay equity efforts while important are still just a first step because equal pay for women does not mean equal opportunity or equal treatment or equal sacrifice paying a female employee the same as a male employee doesnt even begin to touch issues around family planning promotions or job security women do more parttime work and more unpaid work than men how do we address that when we dig a little deeper when we peel back that outer layer we see that there are a whole host of barriers facing women in the workplace removing these barriers will take effort leadership and a willingness to change the nature of work as we know it heres where we need to start its time to take a serious look at parental leave and child care policies we should be encouraging women – and men – to make the best decision for their family situation in canada weve given parents more options for parental leave and invested billions in affordable high quality child care we also introduced a really successful child benefit program that gives middle and lowincome parents more money every month to help with the high costs of raising kids and since the canada child benefit gives more money to those who need it most the financial impact on single mothers ‎has been significant last year nearly  of single moms receiving the canada child benefit earned less than  and received about  in total benefits taxfree and lets be clear helping those families has been a key driver of canadas recent economic growth companies should have a formal policy on gender diversity and make the recruitment of women candidates a priority you may remember that we introduced our countrys first genderbalanced cabinet in  the usual suspects complained but guess what two years later chrystia freeland and maryam monsef who are here this week – along with their many female colleagues in cabinet – are serving the country with great distinction and have elevated the level of decisionmaking and debate for everyone in cabinet and in government as corporate leaders consider a genderbalanced board or genderbalanced project teams anytime were looking for a new hire we should be identifying women candidates at a rate equal to men in canada when we look to fill appointments we work to recruit people who reflect the true diversity of our country and we have to recognize that aspects of intersectionality are always at play and require special attention heres an example in  among women who were newly appointed to the boards of fortune  companies  of them were white race religion sexuality socioeconomic status – these are just a few of the ways that women are even further discriminated against and finally folks here is a really big one me too times up the womens march – these movements tell us that we need to have a critical discussion on womens rights equality and the power dynamics of gender sexual harassment for example – in business and in government – is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable as leaders we need to act to show that truly time is up we must each have a wellunderstood established process in place to file allegations of workplace harassment and when we receive those complaints we must take them seriously as women speak up it is our responsibility to listen and more importantly to believe folks treat these not as piecemeal alternatives to how things currently run treat these examples as a fundamental essential shift in the way we operate as governments and corporations are entrusted with a platform and a voice lets use them last year with our neighbours in the us we established the canadaus council for advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders the council just put out an important report – their first of five – focused on supporting and growing womenowned businesses im pleased to announce that the cochairs for the  gender equality advisory council will be melinda gates and isabelle hudon both of these women are global leaders in the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls – and so will ensure that gender equality is a priority through everything the  does this year  will also see canada hosting fortunes most powerful women international summit and  will bring the women deliver conference to vancouver – the
Trump,madam speaker mr vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states and my fellow americans we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential as we begin a new congress i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda it is the agenda of the american people many of us campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nations infrastructure to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts americas interests first there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage to seize it victory is not winning for our party victory is winning for our country this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of americas mission and the power of american pride in  we also celebrate  years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo  astronauts who planted that flag buzz aldrin this year american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets in the  century america saved freedom transformed science and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the  century an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good together we can break decades of political stalemate we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of americas future the decision is ours to make we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction tonight i ask you to choose greatness over the last  years my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades in just over  years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before we have created  million new jobs and importantly added  new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit we virtually ended the estate or death tax on small businesses ranches and family farms we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed right to try my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations we have unleashed a revolution in american energy — the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and now for the first time in  years we are a net exporter of energy after  months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth and america is winning each and every day members of congress the state of our union is strong our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before on friday it was announced that we added another  jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected an economic miracle is taking place in the united states — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesnt work that way this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than  highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and to our country now is the time for bipartisan action believe it or not we have already proven that it is possible in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic va reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans and just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson i was deeply moved in  alice was sentenced to life in prison as a firsttime nonviolent drug offender over the next two decades she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path she had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond alices story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice she served almost  years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life in june i commuted alices sentence — and she is here with us tonight alice thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny when i saw alices beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did the right thing inspired by stories like alices my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the africanamerican community the first step act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive lawabiding citizens now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption as we have seen when we are united we can make astonishing strides for our country now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis the congress has  days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure our southern border now is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection i have ordered another  troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught this is a moral issue the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well‑being of all americans we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways i want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally tonight i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country no issue better illustrates the divide between americas working class and americas political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools and hospitals increased crime and a depleted social safety net tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl the savage gang  now operates in  different american states and they almost all come through our southern border just yesterday an  gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border theyre going to keep streaming back in year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens ive gotten to know many wonderful angel moms dads and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured here tonight is debra bissell just three weeks ago debras parents gerald and sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they were in their eighties and are survived by four children  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharons granddaughter heather and great‑granddaughter madison to debra heather madison please stand few can understand your pain but i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border in the last  years our brave ice officers made  arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly  assaults  sex crimes and  killings we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes ice special agent elvin hernandez when elvin was a boy he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic at the age of eight elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking elvin says if i can make sure these young girls get their justice ive done my job thanks to his work and that of his colleagues more than  women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than  sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year special agent hernandez please stand we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement — and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall

Yoshihide_Suga,i am truly delighted to meet you all students of the vietnamjapan university vju which is a symbol of human resource development projects between japan and asean vju was established based on an agreement between the leaders of japan and vietnam it is a symbol of japanasean cooperation especially the training and education of the next generation of global talents i am greatly honored to deliver a speech on my first overseas visit after taking office as prime minister in front of you who are studying here to go on to eventually forge the future of vietnam asean and the world a month ago i took office as prime minister taking over the position of former prime minister abe shinzo who resigned due to his health issues former prime minister abe devoted himself to advancing japanasean relations including by establishing the vju i too would like to continue deepening the friendship and cooperation with the people of asean please allow me to introduce myself a little bit in the hope that you may find something congenial in me in the same way i feel a strong affinity with your country and asean i hear that it snows in the northern part of vietnam but you would be surely surprised to see snowfall in my hometown that is akita prefecture located in the northern part of japan it is an area where it snows so heavily that snow can pile up even higher than the first story of a house i was born and brought up as a son of a farmer in the deep snows of akita after graduating from high school i moved to tokyo to challenge myself and began working at a small factory however i was soon faced with the harsh reality figuring that i could not change my life without university education i entered a university two years later than my peers perhaps my feelings at that time were similar to yours as you study and prepare for bounds and leaps in your future i worked parttime to earn my living and academic fees upon graduating from university i worked in the private sector however realizing that it might be politics that is steering this country i entered the world of politics at the age of  which was  years ago after serving as secretary for a member of the diet for eleven years i became a member of a local assembly at the age of  confronted with the need to change national politics to develop rural areas i aspired to enter national politics and became a member of the diet when i was  subsequently i became a cabinet minister and served as chief cabinet secretary under former prime minister abe and assumed the office of prime minister last month ever since entering politics i have always thought about how best to improve peoples lives in any way i can and have worked hard at it with the support of many people as a result i have come thus far to shoulder the formidable responsibilities as the prime minister of japan leading the cabinet working for the people come to think of it the path i have carved out as a politician may be akin to the one japan has taken in the postwar period starting from zero and achieving growth through diligent efforts at the same time the path may be somewhat likened to the trajectory of asean asean has achieved remarkable growth and become the center of global growth this explains why i feel a sense of affinity with your country and asean japan and asean helping each other as friends in asia asean and japan are equal partners and friends we support each other by working side by side learning from one another and working together in pursuit of growth our relationship remains exactly a hearttoheart relationship this is amply illustrated by the recent response to the  pandemic following the outbreak of  supply chains were cut short around the world leaving many countries suffering from shortages of medical supplies japan also ran short of medical supplies and as chief cabinet secretary i exerted myself to secure supplies and distribute them on site i was deeply moved when vietnam sent  million face masks to japan under such circumstances this cooperation symbolizes the strategic partnership between our countries furthermore indonesia which is my next destination on this tour resumed exporting medical surgical clothing by exempting it from the application of an export ban despite being in a difficult situation amid the fight against  this is to my mind more proof of the resilience of the strategic partnership in which countries help each other in need japan has been providing medical supplies and equipment in the form of grant aid and assisting human resource development with a view to contributing to strengthening health and medical care systems and improving public health in asean in addition at an unprecedented speed japan is implementing the  crisis response emergency support yen loans worth up to  billion yen over the next two years to support economic activities of countries with a focus on the indopacific region including asean these instances of cooperation also serve universal health coverage uhc a goal that japan has been striving for together with asean moreover japan and asean are currently working together towards the establishment of the asean centre for public health emergencies and emerging diseases with the aim to strengthen aseans response capacity to infectious diseases we have never forgotten how asean countries helped us as friends nine and a half years ago when the great east japan earthquake struck japan i believe that the ability to help each other in crises and respond swiftly to emerging challenges is another trait of the cooperation between japan and asean as equal partners improving connectivity hard and soft infrastructure and towards digital technology and the resilience of supply chains asean embraces diversity respects one another and emphasizes consensus japan believes that fully supporting asean which has moved forward with regional integration and developed in such spirit will lead to peace stability and prosperity in the region including japan based on this belief for the last several decades japan has been supporting aseans centrality and unity through a whole range of cooperation the supply chain is an essential and integral element of modern day international business this trend was ushered in by the investment of japanese companies in asean japanese automobile manufacturers establishing factories in thailand in the  became the first of many investments made by a diverse range of japanese enterprises in asean in this process japanese companies enhanced the expertise of their local employees in host countries through training and contributed to nurturing local businesses as i see it the official development assistance oda in combination with investment from japanese companies have been instrumental in aseans sustainable development as if they were the two wheels of a cart a typical example of oda cooperation is infrastructure development which enhances the connectivity of the region this means building social infrastructure conducive to economic growth such as ports roads railways airports and industrial compounds in an open manner and connecting them across national borders to form economic corridors examples of this cooperation include the eastwest economic corridor and the southern economic corridor running through vietnam laos cambodia thailand and myanmar japan will continue to support asean countries endeavors to strengthen mutual connectivity within the region and develop together as the entire region i am delighted that collaboration between japan and asean is still continuing in laying foundations for the asean economy which is vital to japanese companies as well on the basis of such physical connectivity japan and asean are also jointly engaging in rulemaking towards strengthening of the international economic system taking on the challenge to improve connectivity of soft infrastructure after the turn of the  century during rapid globalization rulemaking on trade and investment had made little headway due to stalled wto round negotiations this prompted japan and asean to reduce trade barriers by concluding bilateral economic partnership agreements starting with the japansingapore economic partnership agreement and the aseanjapan comprehensive economic partnership ajcep and also to pursue rulemaking on regional economic activities looking forward the key word for further improving connectivity is digital technology and the resilience of supply chains first digital technology today digital technology and data transcend national borders connect economies and influence all kinds of social activities we will facilitate rulemaking based on data free flow with trust or dfft while promoting jointly with asean countries the digitalization of our economies and societies and the enhancement of digital connectivity all of which have grown in significance through responses to the  pandemic the aseanjapan cybersecurity capacity building centre established in bangkok two years ago by japans cooperation contributes to safeguarding regional cyberspace together and to creating economies that enable companies to do business safely next the resilience of supply chains the  pandemic once again shed light on the necessity to lower risks of cutoffs build a sustainable supply system and enhance its resilience in order to maintain international supply chains this is the reason why many japanese companies are striving to diversify supply chains by extending them to asean japan will further strengthen cooperation with asean to increase the resilience of supply chains and build economies in asia that are resilient to crises human resource development through personal interaction that further solidifies partnerships connectivity to be created by asean and japan is underpinned by the human resources of asean infrastructure and systems only work with the people who operate them because asean has been nurtured in an environment rich in diversity and internationality it is abundant with human resources envied by the world to contribute to the development of human resources japan has been working in tandem with asean to assist capacity building through the exchange of people including jica experts japan overseas cooperation volunteers jocv training in japan and japanese government scholarship students an excellent example of such human resource development is this vju which set up undergraduate courses starting this year in addition to the existing graduate courses at the same time human resources full of youth and vitality such as technical intern trainees coming from asean countries to japan have become crucial to the lives and the economy of japanese people based on this situation two years ago as the chief cabinet secretary i spearheaded domestic regulation reform and made it possible for skilled personnel in  fields to work in japan this specified skilled worker scheme has been implemented since april  we are undertaking comprehensive measures at the workplace municipalities and in education so that japan will be chosen by foreign workers and creating an accepting environment which will invite you to conclude that you want to work in japan i am convinced that this kind of relationship i just mentioned has been instrumental in reinforcing the partnership between asean and japan thanks to human interaction through the cultivation of human resources numerous japanese people became fond of asean i really hope that in the same way many people in asean have come to love japan nobody understands better than me the importance of peopletopeople exchanges in my capacity as chief cabinet secretary i focused on an inbound tourism initiative as a pillar of the governments growth strategy and advocated for easing requirements for foreign visitors to obtain visas a reform that had been stalled due to red tape as a result of this reform the number of visitors to japan last year reached approximately  million growing nearly fourfold from  million in  furthermore my country has been carrying out the wa project to foster cultural exchange between japan and asean through fine arts and the japanese language i believe the project has created many fans of japan and motivated many to visit japan i am hoping to announce attractive cultural exchange projects
